Transfer to creditor of consideration for sale invalid

\(2\)  In case of a valid sale of goods or other property and payment or transfer of the consideration or part thereof by the purchaser to a creditor of the vendor under circumstances that would render void such a payment or transfer by the debtor personally and directly, the payment or transfer, even though valid as respects the purchaser, is void as respects the creditor to whom it is made\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. A\.33, s\. 5 \(2\)\.

Effect of assignment not in accordance with Act

\(3\)  Every assignment for the general benefit of creditors that is not void under section 4, but is not made to the sheriff nor to any other person with the prescribed consent of creditors, is void as against a subsequent assignment that is in conformity with this Act, and is subject in other respects to the provisions thereof until and unless a subsequent assignment is executed in accordance therewith\.

exchange of securities

	\(c\)	applies to the substitution in good faith of one security for another security for the same debt so far as the debtor’s estate is not thereby lessened in value to the other creditors; or

certain securities to be valid

	\(d\)	invalidates a security given to a creditor for a pre\-existing debt where, by reason or on account of the giving of the security, an advance in money is made to the debtor by the creditor in the belief that the advance will enable the debtor to continue the debtor’s trade or business and to pay the debts in full\.

R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. A\.33, s\. 7\.

All assignments for general benefit of creditors to be subject to this Act

<a id="BK7"></a>__8 __Every assignment for the general benefit of creditors, whether it is or is not expressed to be made under or in pursuance of this Act and whether the assignment does or does not include all the real and personal estate of the assignor, vests the estate, whether real or personal or partly real and partly personal, thereby assigned in the assignee therein named for the general benefit of creditors, and the assignment and the property thereby assigned is subject to all the provisions of this Act, and the same applies to the assignee named in the assignment\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. A\.33, s\. 8\.

How claims are to rank where different estates

<a id="BK8"></a>__9 __If an assignor executing an assignment under this Act for the general benefit of creditors owes debts both individually and as a member of a partnership or as a member of different partnerships, the claims rank first upon the estate by which the debts they represent were contracted and only rank upon the other or others after all the creditors of such other estate or estates have been paid in full\.

R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. A\.33, s\. 10 \(4\)\.

Registration

\(5\)  A verified copy of the resolution or of the order may be registered in the proper land registry office and the registration thereof has the same effect as the registration of a conveyance\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. A\.33, s\. 10 \(5\)\.

Rights of assignee

Right of creditor in certain cases if assignee refuses

\(2\)  Where a creditor desires to cause any proceeding to be taken that, in the creditor’s opinion, would be for the benefit of the estate and the assignee under the authority of the creditors or inspectors refuses or neglects to take such proceeding after being required so to do, the creditor has the right to obtain an order of the judge authorizing the creditor to take the proceeding in the name of the assignee, but at the creditor’s own expense and risk, upon such terms and conditions as to indemnity to the assignee as the judge prescribes, and thereupon any benefit derived from the proceeding, to the extent of the claim and full costs, belongs exclusively to the creditor instituting the proceeding for his, her or its benefit, but, if before such order is obtained the assignee signifies to the judge a readiness to institute the proceeding for the benefit of the creditors, the order shall prescribe the time within which to do so, and in that case the advantage derived from the proceeding, if instituted within such time, belongs to the estate\.

Following proceeds of property fraudulently transferred

<a id="BK11"></a>__12 __\(1\)  In the case of a gift, conveyance, assignment or transfer of any property, real or personal, that is invalid against creditors, if the person to whom the gift, conveyance, assignment or transfer was made has sold or disposed of, realized or collected the property or any part thereof, the money or other proceeds may be seized or recovered in an action by a person who would be entitled to seize and recover the property if it had remained in the possession or control of the debtor or of the person to whom the gift, conveyance, transfer, delivery or payment was made, and such right to seize and recover belongs not only to an assignee for the general benefit of the creditors of the debtor but, where there is no such assignment, to all creditors of the debtor\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. A\.33, s\. 12 \(1\)\.

Amendment by judge

<a id="BK14"></a>__15 __No advantage shall be obtained by any creditor by reason of any mistake, defect or imperfection in an assignment under this Act for the general benefit of creditors if the assignment can be amended or corrected, and any such mistake, defect or imperfection shall be amended by the judge on the application of the assignee or of any creditor of the assignor, and on such notice to other parties concerned as the judge thinks reasonable, and the amendment, when made, shall be related back to the date of the assignment, but not so as to prejudice the rights of innocent purchasers\.

R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. A\.33, s\. 24 \(4\)\.

Right to revalue in certain cases

\(5\)  If a creditor’s claim is based upon a negotiable instrument upon which the assignor is only indirectly or secondarily liable and that is not mature or exigible, the creditor shall be considered to hold security within the meaning of this section and shall put a value on the liability of the person primarily liable thereon as being the security for the payment thereof, but after the maturity of such liability and its non\-payment the creditor is entitled to amend the claim and revalue the security\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. A\.33, s\. 24 \(5\)\.

Where creditor holding security fails to value it

\(6\)  Where a person claiming to be entitled to rank on the estate holds security for the claim, or any part thereof, of such a nature that the person is required by this Act to value the security and fails to value it, the judge, upon summary application by the assignee or by any other person interested in the estate, of which application at least three days notice shall be given to the claimant, may order that, unless a specified value be placed on the security and the assignee is notified in writing within a time to be limited by the order, the claimant is, in respect of the claim, or the part thereof for which the security is held in case the security is held for part only of the claim, wholly barred of any right to share in the proceeds of the estate\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. A\.33, s\. 24 \(6\)\.

Limiting time for proof of claim

\(2\)  Where a person claiming to be entitled to rank on the estate does not, within a reasonable time after receiving notice of the assignment and of the name and address of the assignee, furnish to the assignee satisfactory proofs of claim as provided by this and the preceding sections, the judge upon summary application by the assignee or by any other person interested in the estate, of which application at least three days notice shall be given to the claimant, may order that unless the claim is proved to the satisfaction of the judge within a time to be limited by the order, the claimant shall be deemed to be no longer a creditor of the estate and is wholly barred of any right to share in the proceeds thereof\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. A\.33, s\. 25 \(2\)\.

Consequences of neglect to prove claim

\(3\)  If the claim is not so proved within the time so limited or within such further time as the judge by subsequent order allows, it is wholly barred and the assignee is at liberty to distribute the proceeds of the estate as if no such claim existed, but without prejudice to the liability of the assignor therefor\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. A\.33, s\. 25 \(3\)\.

Creditor may prove claim not due

\(5\)  A person whose claim has not accrued due is nevertheless entitled to prove under the assignment and to vote at meetings of creditors, but in ascertaining the amount of any such claim a deduction for interest shall be made for the time that has to run until the claim becomes due\.
