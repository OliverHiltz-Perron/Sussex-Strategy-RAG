Definitions

1 In this Schedule,

“review panel” means a panel selected under subsection 2 \(1\); \(“comité de révision”\)

“the Act” means the Health Insurance Act\. \(“la Loi”\)

Request for a hearing, general

2 \(1\)  When the Appeal Board receives a notice that requests a hearing under paragraph 3 or 4 of subsection 20 \(1\) of the Act and proof of service of the notice, the chair of the Appeal Board or, in his or her absence, a vice chair shall select a panel in accordance with section 4 to hear and determine the matter before it\.

Timing

\(2\)  A panel selected under subsection \(1\) shall conduct the hearing in a timely manner within the prescribed time, if any, and shall make an order with written reasons within 30 business days of the close of submissions, or, if another time has been prescribed, within that time\.

Parties

\(3\)  The parties to a hearing under subsection \(1\) are the General Manager and the physician or physicians named in the notice that requests a hearing\.

Order of Appeal Board

\(4\)  An order of a review panel is for all purposes an order of the Appeal Board\.

Period of review

3 The physician under review shall only be required to reimburse the Plan for services provided in a period that is no more than 24 months in duration and that commenced no more than five years before the General Manager’s request for a review\.

Panels

4 A review panel shall consist of three members of the Appeal Board selected as follows:

	1\.	The chair of the Appeal Board or, in his or her absence, a vice chair shall select the members of the panel that will conduct the hearing and determine the matter before it\. The chair or the vice chair may be a member of a panel\.

	2\.	One of the members must be a physician, but no more than one\.

	3\.	At least one member must be a member of the Law Society of Ontario who is licensed to practise law in Ontario as a barrister and solicitor\.

Hearing by review panel

5 A review panel shall hear and determine the matter before it\.

Orders

6 \(1\)  The review panel may, as an order of the Appeal Board, make any order that it considers appropriate, including, without being limited to, any one or more of the following:

	1\.	An order determining the proper amount, if any, to be paid to the physician in accordance with the Act and the regulations for the service provided, and requiring that the General Manager pay the account in the amount set out in the order or that the physician reimburse the Plan in the amount set out in the order\.

	2\.	An order that, in the future, the physician submit claims for insured services to the Plan or to insured persons in accordance with the order of the Appeal Board\.

Additional orders

\(2\)  The General Manager may enter in evidence before the review panel a random sample of claims submitted by the physician to the Plan in respect of a fee code during the period of review and, in addition to any other order it may make under subsection \(1\), the review panel may, in circumstances that it considers appropriate, order that the General Manager calculate the amount to be reimbursed for that fee code for that period, or a portion of that period, by assuming the results observed in the random sample are representative of all the claims during the period in question, where the review panel determines that,

	\(a\)	the physician is liable to reimburse the Plan; and

	\(b\)	the sample was random and had a reasonable confidence interval\.

Effect of suspension, etc\.

\(3\)  If a physician is the subject of an order under paragraph 3 of subsection \(1\), all insured services rendered by him or her during the period the order is in effect are deemed to be insured services payable at nil\.
