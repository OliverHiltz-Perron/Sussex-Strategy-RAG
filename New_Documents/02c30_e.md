	3\.	A representation that the goods or services are of a particular standard, quality, grade, style or model, if they are not\.

	4\.	A representation that the goods are new, or unused, if they are not or are reconditioned or reclaimed, but the reasonable use of goods to enable the person to service, prepare, test and deliver the goods does not result in the goods being deemed to be used for the purposes of this paragraph\.

	5\.	A representation that the goods have been used to an extent that is materially different from the fact\.

	6\.	A representation that the goods or services are available for a reason that does not exist\.

	7\.	A representation that the goods or services have been supplied in accordance with a previous representation, if they have not\.

Same

\(2\)  Without limiting the generality of what may be taken into account in determining whether a representation is unconscionable, there may be taken into account that the person making the representation or the person’s employer or principal knows or ought to know,

	\(b\)	that the price grossly exceeds the price at which similar goods or services are readily available to like consumers;

	\(c\)	that the consumer is unable to receive a substantial benefit from the subject\-matter of the representation;

	\(d\)	that there is no reasonable probability of payment of the obligation in full by the consumer;

	\(e\)	that the consumer transaction is excessively one\-sided in favour of someone other than the consumer;
