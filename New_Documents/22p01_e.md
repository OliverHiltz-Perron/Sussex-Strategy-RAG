Preamble

On September 11, 2001 the terrorist attacks in the United States of America took the lives of thousands of citizens from 90 countries, including 24 citizens of Canada\.

By proclaiming September 11 in each year as the Provincial Day of Service, Ontario honours those who lost their lives in the attacks, pays respect to families and friends who still feel their loss and acknowledges the incredible acts of courage, sacrifice and kindness that were made on and following that day\. The Province also demonstrates its support for the members of the military, law enforcement and intelligence personnel who continue to fight on the front lines against all forms of terrorism\.

On this day every year, Ontarians will rekindle the spirit of kindness, generosity and goodwill that unified us on September 11, 2001\. It is a day to pause, remember and to be inspired to show the same kind of compassion to strangers in need, by engaging on that day in charitable activities, fundraisers, good deeds and community service for worthy causes\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Provincial Day of Service

__1 __September 11 in each year is proclaimed as the Provincial Day of Service\.

__2__ Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

__3__ Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
