Preamble

Nurse practitioners are registered nurses with advanced university education who provide personalized, quality health care to patients\. Ontario nurse practitioners provide a full range of health care services to individuals, families and communities in a variety of settings, including hospitals and community\-based clinics in cities and smaller towns in Ontario\. They work in partnership with physicians, nurses and other health care professionals such as social workers, midwives, mental health professionals and pharmacists to keep Ontarians well\.  

It is appropriate to celebrate and recognize the valuable contributions made by nurse practitioners in Ontario\.  It is also important to draw attention to the remaining barriers to their full integration into Ontario’s health care system\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Nurse Practitioner Week

<a id="s1"></a>	__[1\.](http://www.ontario.ca/fr/lois/loi/16n36" \l "s1)  __The second full week of November in each year is proclaimed as Nurse Practitioner Week\.
