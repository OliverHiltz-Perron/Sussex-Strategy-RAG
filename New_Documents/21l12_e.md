Preamble

Lupus is an auto\-immune disease which is typically characterized by inflammation in one or more parts of the body\. It belongs to the family of diseases that includes rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, juvenile diabetes and scleroderma\. 

The disease affects one out of every 1,000 Canadian men, women and children\. However, women are eight times more likely to contract the disease, particularly women between the ages of 15 to 45 years\. 

Although the cause of the disease still remains largely unknown, certain properties of the disease are discernible\. Lupus attacks the body’s immune system, leaving it unable to differentiate between intruders and healthy tissue\. As a result, vital organs are damaged, causing pain and organ dysfunction in the body\. 

The diagnosis and treatment for lupus are improving, allowing most people with lupus to live active and productive lives\. Increasingly, the disease can be treated and controlled\. It may come and go in cycles or, in a few cases, go into a permanent remission\. However, sometimes lupus cannot be controlled and is fatal\.

A better understanding of the disease and its symptoms are conducive to improving the diagnosis and treatment of the disease\. Proclaiming a day of awareness of lupus will help to inspire, inform and support individuals with lupus and others\. Many countries in the world, including the United States of America and the United Kingdom, have recognized May 10 as World Lupus Day and associate the colour purple with that day\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Lupus Awareness Day

__1 __\(1\)  May 10__ __in each year is recognized as Lupus Awareness Day\.

Same

\(2\)  On Lupus Awareness Day, all Ontarians are encouraged to wear an item of the colour purple\.

__2 __Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

__3 __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
