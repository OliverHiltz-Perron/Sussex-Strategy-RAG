Preamble

<a id="BK0"></a>The people of Ontario support the right of persons of all ages with disabilities to enjoy equal opportunity and to participate fully in the life of the province\.

Ontarians with disabilities experience barriers to participating in the mainstream of Ontario society\.  The number of persons with disabilities is expected to increase as the population ages, since the incidence of disability increases with age\.

The Government of Ontario is committed to working with every sector of society to build on what it has already achieved together with those sectors and to move towards a province in which no new barriers are created and existing ones are removed\.  This responsibility rests with every social and economic sector, every region, every government, every organization, institution and association, and every person in Ontario\.

The right of persons with disabilities to equal treatment without discrimination in accordance with the Human Rights Code is addressed in a number of Ontario statutes and regulations\. Some of these are set out below\.

The Assessment Act provides for exemptions from property taxation where improvements, alterations or additions to existing homes or designated portions of new homes are made or built to accommodate persons with disabilities who would otherwise require care in an institution\.

The Blind Persons’ Rights Act prohibits discrimination in services, accommodation, facilities or occupancy against blind persons using guide dogs and prohibits persons who are not blind from using white canes\.

The Building Code Act, 1992 and the regulations made under it establish standards for the construction, renovation and change of use of buildings and structures, including standards related to the accessibility of buildings and structures for persons with disabilities\.

As an incentive to encourage employers to hire persons with disabilities, the Corporations Tax Act allows employers an additional deduction for the costs of modifying buildings, structures and premises, acquiring certain equipment and providing special training in order to accommodate persons with disabilities in the workplace\.  The Income Tax Act provides a similar credit to unincorporated employers\.

The Education Act includes provisions to address the needs of students with disabilities who have been identified as “exceptional pupils”\. School boards must provide special education programs and services to these students\.

Note: On a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor, the French version of the Preamble to the Act is amended\. \(See: 2023, c\. 11, Sched\. 2, s\. 34\)

The Ontario Disability Support Program Act, 1997 provides a separate income and employment support program for eligible persons with disabilities\.  It removes persons with disabilities from the welfare system and provides them with assistance that recognizes their unique needs\.

The Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997 provides loss of earnings, health care and labour market re\-entry benefits for persons with work\-related injuries and disabilities\.

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms also provides that persons with disabilities are equal before and under the law and have the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law\.

The Government of Ontario believes that all governments in Canada have a responsibility to enact legislation to improve opportunities for persons with disabilities by comprehensively identifying, removing and preventing barriers to their participation in the life of the jurisdictions of those governments\.

The Government of Ontario believes that it is desirable to demonstrate continued leadership in improving opportunities for persons with disabilities\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:
