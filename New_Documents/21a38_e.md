Preamble

People of Asian heritage have experienced a heightened rate of race\-related incidents during the COVID\-19 pandemic\.

Asian Canadians are visible minorities and have long been viewed as foreigners and outsiders and are easy targets for people to direct their frustration and anger\.

Education can play an important role in addressing and eliminating racism and discrimination\. With education, we have the opportunity to change the way the public views and treats Asian Canadians\. They should be viewed and treated as vital contributors to our Canadian multicultural society\. Their contributions to this country are historical, dating back to the late\-1700s and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, along with many other notable achievements that benefit Canada’s culture, economy and innovation\.

By proclaiming May as Anti\-Asian Racism Education Month, the Province of Ontario honours the proud contributions, storied history and sacrifices made by Canadians of Asian heritage in building this country\. It will also help to combat and eliminate anti\-Asian racism in our schools, our communities and our province\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Anti\-Asian Racism Education Month

__1 __The month of May in each year is proclaimed as Anti\-Asian Racism Education Month\.

2 Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

3__ __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
