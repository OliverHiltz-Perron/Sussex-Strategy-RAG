Preamble

Each year, approximately 7,000 Ontarians will experience cardiac arrest\. Up to 85 per cent of cardiac arrests occur at home or in public places\. Almost half of cardiac arrests are witnessed by a family member or friend\. When used in conjunction with CPR in the first few minutes after a cardiac arrest, defibrillation can dramatically improve cardiac arrest survival rates by more than 50 per cent\. Ensuring that automated external defibrillators are available to members of the public may prevent tragedies from occurring\. 

Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:
