Preamble

<a id="BK0"></a>The Government of Ontario recognizes the seriousness of the issue of missing persons in Ontario and its negative impact on the family and loved ones of missing persons\. The families and loved ones of missing persons have requested that the Government of Ontario enhance the tools available to police when attempting to locate missing persons\.

The Government of Ontario recognizes that the circumstances surrounding each missing person’s absence are unique, but that sexism, racism, transphobia, homophobia, other forms of marginalization and the legacy of colonization are factors that may increase the risk of a person becoming a missing person\.

The Government of Ontario acknowledges the importance of timely and effective measures being available to police to assist with locating missing persons\. These measures must also take into account people’s privacy interests and agency\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Order not precluded
