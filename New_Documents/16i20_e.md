Preamble

Muslims have been contributing to all aspects of Ontario’s prosperity and diverse heritage for generations\.

Islamic history and culture encompass a broad range of individual and collective experiences, as well as important contributions to literature, math, science, art and history\.

In 2007 the Government of Canada declared the month of October in each year as Canadian Islamic History Month\.

The Province of Ontario recognizes and wishes to affirm the important contributions that Muslims make in Ontario as part of the vibrant social, economic, political and cultural fabric of our province\.

Proclaiming a month to be Islamic Heritage Month in Ontario will provide all Ontarians, both today and in future generations, with an opportunity to reflect, celebrate and learn about the rich and longstanding Islamic history in the Province and the diverse roles and contributions of Muslim people in communities across Ontario\. This new understanding will in turn help combat anti\-Islamic sentiment\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Islamic Heritage Month

<a id="s1"></a>	[1\.](http://www.ontario.ca/fr/lois/loi/16i20" \l "s1)__  __The month of October in each year is proclaimed as Islamic Heritage Month\.

<a id="s3"></a>	[3\.](http://www.ontario.ca/fr/lois/loi/16i20" \l "s3)  Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
