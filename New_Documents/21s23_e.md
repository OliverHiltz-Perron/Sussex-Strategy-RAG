Preamble

Ontario has a vibrant community of seniors \(persons 65 years of age and older\) who impact their communities through volunteering\. Some estimates indicate that well over half a million seniors in Ontario volunteer\.

Seniors volunteer in both formal and informal ways\. For example, many seniors volunteer their time in familial settings through such activities as providing child care for family members\. Seniors also perform more formal volunteer activities in the health, educational, religious, social, community and entrepreneurial sectors\.

Volunteering has many demonstrated benefits for seniors, including providing a sense of accomplishment and belonging to the community, reducing social isolation and providing an opportunity to build on life experiences in a positive way\.

Proclaiming a week of appreciation will motivate our communities to show appreciation for our senior volunteers\. It will also encourage seniors to stay active and to continue to participate in community life\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Senior Volunteer Appreciation Week

__1 __\(1\)  The first seven days of June in each year are proclaimed as Senior Volunteer Appreciation Week\.

Same

\(2\)  During that week, all Ontarians who interact with a volunteer who is approximately 65 years of age or older are encouraged to wear a yellow\-coloured item to display their appreciation\.

__2 __Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

__3 __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
