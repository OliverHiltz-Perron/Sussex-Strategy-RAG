When writs of execution are binding

Definition

<a id="BK8"></a>__10 __\(0\.1\)  In this section and section 11,

“index” means the electronic database maintained by the sheriff as the index of writs of execution\. 2024, c\. 2, Sched\. 8, s\. 1 \(1\)\.

When binding against personal property

\(1\)  A writ of execution against real property and personal property or against only personal property and any renewal of it binds the personal property against which it is issued from the time it is filed with the sheriff and entered into the index\.  2010, c\. 16, Sched\. 2, s\. 3 \(16\); 2024, c\. 2, Sched\. 8, s\. 1 \(2\)\.

Execution issued out of Small Claims Court

\(2\)  Despite subsection \(1\), a writ of seizure and sale of personal property issued out of the Small Claims Court,

	\(a\)	is not entered into the index; and

	\(b\)	is binding on personal property of the execution debtor only from the time the personal property is seized\.  2010, c\. 16, Sched\. 2, s\. 3 \(16\); 2024, c\. 2, Sched\. 8, s\. 1 \(3\)\.

Exception, purchaser in good faith

\(3\)  Despite subsection \(1\), no writ of execution against personal property, other than bills of sale and instruments in the nature of chattel mortgages, prejudices the title to the personal property if the personal property is acquired by a person in good faith and for valuable consideration unless the person had notice at the time of acquiring title to the personal property that a writ of execution under which the personal property of the execution debtor might be seized or attached has been filed with the sheriff and remains unexecuted\.  2010, c\. 16, Sched\. 2, s\. 3 \(16\)\.

Obligations of sheriff re index

\(4\)  A sheriff shall comply with the following requirements respecting the index:

	1\.	If a writ of execution, a renewal of a writ of execution or a certificate of lien under the Bail Act is directed to the sheriff, the sheriff shall, upon receiving from or on behalf of the judgment creditor the required fee in accordance with the Administration of Justice Act and instructions to do so, promptly take the following actions:

	i\.	Enter in the index the writ, renewal or certificate of lien, as the case may be\.

	ii\.	If applicable, indicate in the index that the writ, renewal or certificate of lien, as the case may be, affects real property governed by the Land Titles Act\.

	2\.	A sheriff shall assign consecutive numbers in the index to each writ and certificate of lien in the order in which the writs and certificates of lien are entered\.

	3\.	A sheriff shall note in the index the effective date of each writ, renewal and certificate of lien\.

	4\.	In the case of a renewal, a sheriff shall extend the expiry date by the period required under the applicable rule or statute\.

	5\.	A sheriff shall update the names of execution debtors in the index as directed by the court\.

	6\.	A sheriff shall note in the index any statutory declaration filed under clause 11 \(1\) \(b\)\.

	7\.	A sheriff shall give the land registrar of each land titles division wholly or partially within the sheriff’s jurisdiction access to the index\. 2024, c\. 2, Sched\. 8, s\. 1 \(4\)\.

\(5\)  Repealed: 2024, c\. 2, Sched\. 8, s\. 1 \(4\)\.

When binding against lands

\(6\)  Subject to section 11 and the Land Titles Act, a writ of execution, a renewal of it or a certificate of lien under the Bail Act binds the lands against which it is issued from the effective date of the writ, renewal or certificate noted in the index\.  2010, c\. 16, Sched\. 2, s\. 3 \(16\); 2024, c\. 2, Sched\. 8, s\. 1 \(5\)\.

Writ not to bind lands unless name of debtor sufficient

<a id="BK9"></a>__11 __\(1\)  Where the name of an execution debtor set out in a writ of execution is not that of a corporation or the firm name of a partnership, the writ does not bind the lands of the execution debtor unless,

	\(a\)	the name of the execution debtor set out in the writ includes at least one given name in full; or

	\(b\)	a statutory declaration of the execution creditor or execution creditor’s solicitor is filed with the sheriff identifying the execution debtor by at least one given name in full\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. E\.24, s\. 11 \(1\)\.

When writ binds land

\(2\)  Subject to subsection \(3\), where a statutory declaration is filed under clause \(1\) \(b\), the name of the execution debtor set out in the writ shall be deemed to contain the given names affirmed in the declaration and the writ binds land from the time the declaration is noted in the index\.
