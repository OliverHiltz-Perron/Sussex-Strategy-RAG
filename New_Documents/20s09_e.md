Onus of proof

\(3\)  In the prosecution of an offence under subsection 5 \(1\), \(2\), \(3\) or \(4\) or 6 \(2\),

	\(a\)	the consent of the owner or occupier of the farm, animal processing facility or prescribed premises or the consent of the driver of the motor vehicle transporting a farm animal, as the case may be, is presumed not to have been given; and

	\(b\)	the onus is on the person charged with the offence to prove on the balance of probabilities that he or she obtained the consent of the owner or occupier or the consent of the driver, as the case may be, before engaging in the conduct that he or she is accused of doing without consent\.

Same, sign

\(4\)  For the purposes of subsection \(3\), consent is sufficiently proven if the defendant establishes on the balance of probabilities that,

	\(a\)	a sign was posted at or near the animal protection zone on the farm, animal processing facility or prescribed premises authorizing persons to enter in or on the animal protection zone or authorizing the interference or interaction with farm animals or the carrying out of the prescribed activity in or on the animal protection zone; and

	\(b\)	the defendant reasonably believed that the sign authorized the defendant to enter the animal protection zone on the farm, animal processing facility or prescribed premises or to interfere or interact with the farm animal or to carry out the prescribed activity in or on the animal protection zone\.

Colour of right as defence

\(5\)  It is a defence to a charge of contravening subsection 5 \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\) or \(7\) that the person charged reasonably believed that he or she had title to or other legal interest in an animal protection zone on the farm, animal processing facility or prescribed premises that entitled him or her to enter the animal protection zone or to do anything that is prohibited under subsection 5 \(4\) or \(7\)\.

Same, s\. 6 \(2\)

\(6\)  It is a defence to a charge of contravening subsection 6 \(2\) that the person charged reasonably believed that he or she had title to or other legal interest in the farm animal that entitled him or her to interfere or interact with the farm animal\.

Use of motor vehicle

\(7\)  If a motor vehicle is used to commit an offence under paragraph 1 or 3 of subsection \(1\), the driver of the motor vehicle is guilty of an offence under this Act\.

Motor vehicle owner and driver liable

\(8\)  If the driver of a motor vehicle that is used to commit an offence under paragraph 1 or 3 of subsection \(1\) is not the owner of the motor vehicle, then, upon the driver being found guilty of the offence, both the driver and the owner of the motor vehicle shall be held jointly and severally liable to pay the fine payable for the offence under section 15 unless, at the time the offence was committed, the motor vehicle was in the driver’s possession without the consent of the owner\.

Notice to motor vehicle owner

\(9\)  Despite subsection \(8\), the owner of a motor vehicle shall not be held jointly and severally liable to pay a fine under that subsection unless notice that the motor vehicle was used to commit the offence in question is provided to the owner by a police officer promptly after the driver of the motor vehicle is charged with the offence\.

Penalties

<a id="BK17"></a>__15 __\(1\)  A person who is found guilty of an offence under subsection 14 \(1\) is liable on conviction to a fine of,

	\(a\)	for a first offence, not more than $15,000; and

	\(b\)	for any subsequent offence, not more than $25,000\.

Increased penalties

\(2\)  If a person is found guilty of an offence as a result of a contravention of subsection 5 \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\) or \(7\) or 6 \(1\) or \(2\) and the court finds that the offence was committed in prescribed circumstances that resulted in an increase to the gravity of the offence, the amount of the penalty may be increased in accordance with the regulations\.

Decision not to increase

\(3\)  If a court determines that the amount of a penalty should not be increased despite the existence of prescribed circumstances mentioned in subsection \(2\), the court shall include the reasons for this determination in its decision\.

Restitution for damages

<a id="BK18"></a>__16 __\(1\)  If a person is found guilty of an offence as a result of a contravention of subsection 5 \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\) or \(7\) or 6 \(1\) or \(2\), the court may make a restitution order requiring the person found guilty of the offence to pay damages to an owner or occupier of a farm, animal processing facility or prescribed premises or to a driver of a motor vehicle transporting farm animals for any injury, loss or damage suffered by the owner, occupier or driver during or as a result of the commission of the offence, including losses or damages resulting from a disease contracted by farm animals as a result of the commission of the offence\.

Restitution order

\(2\)  A court shall make a restitution order under subsection \(1\) only if,

	\(a\)	the restitution order is requested by the prosecutor;

	\(b\)	the person who suffered the injury, loss or damage consents to the order being made; and

	\(c\)	the injury, loss or damage that are the object of the restitution order are readily ascertainable\.

More than one trespasser

\(3\)  Two or more persons who entered in or on an animal protection zone together contrary to subsection 5 \(1\), \(2\) or \(3\) shall be jointly and severally liable for any damages payable to the owner or occupier of the farm, animal processing facility or prescribed premises pursuant to a restitution order made under subsection \(1\) if,

	\(a\)	they have each been found guilty of an offence under subsection 5 \(1\), \(2\) or \(3\);

	\(b\)	the restitution order is made against at least one of them; and

	\(c\)	the injury, loss or damage that are the object of the restitution order resulted from acts committed while the persons were all together present in or on the animal protection zone contrary to subsection 5 \(1\), \(2\) or \(3\)\.

Civil action

\(4\)  A restitution order made under subsection \(1\) extinguishes the right of the person who suffered the injury, loss or damage to bring a civil action for damages against the person found guilty of the offence based on the same facts that led to the conviction for the offence unless,

	\(a\)	the amount of damages ordered by the court in the restitution order is less than the value of the injury, loss or damage actually suffered by the person; and

	\(b\)	at the time the restitution order was made, the court could not have reasonably known the extent of the injury, loss or damage\.

Same

\(5\)  The failure of a prosecutor to request a restitution order under subsection \(1\) or a refusal by a court to make the order does not affect a right to bring a civil action for damages arising out of the same facts\.

Same

\(6\)  If a civil action for damages is brought against a person for the tort of trespassing based on the same facts that resulted in the person being found guilty of an offence under this Act, the conviction under this Act shall be sufficient proof of the liability of the person in tort and the only issue to be determined in the civil action shall be the quantum of damages for the tort\.

Costs of prosecution

<a id="BK19"></a>__17 __Despite section 60 of the Provincial Offences Act, if a person is found guilty of an offence under this Act in a prosecution conducted by a private prosecutor, the court shall make a restitution order requiring the person found guilty of the offence to pay to the prosecutor any costs actually and reasonably incurred in conducting the prosecution\.

Fines with restitution

<a id="BK20"></a>__18 __A restitution order under section 16 or 17 may be made in addition to any fine imposed under section 15\.

Enforcement of restitution order

<a id="BK21"></a>__19 __A restitution order made under section 16 or 17 may be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction and, on filing, shall be deemed to be a judgement or order of that court for purposes of enforcement\.

<a id="BK22"></a>General

Limited liability

<a id="BK23"></a>__20 __\(1\)  If a person enters in or on an animal protection zone on a farm, animal processing facility or prescribed premises in contravention of this Act, interferes or interacts with a farm animal or carries out a prescribed activity in or on the animal protection zone in contravention of this Act, the owner or occupier of the farm, facility or premises shall not be liable for any injury, loss or damages suffered by that person unless,

	\(a\)	the owner or occupier created a danger with the deliberate intent of doing harm or damage to the person; or

	\(b\)	the injury, loss or damages were caused by actions taken by the owner or occupier with wilful or reckless disregard for the presence of the person\.

Same, transportation of farm animals

\(2\)  If a person contravenes this Act by stopping, hindering, obstructing or otherwise interfering with a motor vehicle transporting farm animals or by interfering or interacting with a farm animal being transported on a motor vehicle, the driver of the motor vehicle shall not be liable for any injury, loss or damages suffered by that person unless,

	\(a\)	the driver created a danger with the deliberate intent of doing harm or damage to the person; or

	\(b\)	the injury, loss or damages were caused by actions taken by the driver with wilful or reckless disregard for the presence of the person\.

Power to arrest

Limitation on proceedings

<a id="BK24"></a>__21 __\(1\)  No proceeding shall be commenced for an offence under this Act on a day that is more than two years after,

	\(a\)	the day on which the offence was committed; or

Same

\(2\)  In the case of an offence under this Act committed before the day this section comes into force, a proceeding for the offence shall be commenced no later than two years after the day on which the offence was committed\.
