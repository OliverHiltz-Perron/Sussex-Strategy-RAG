Preamble

The spirit of Canada’s greatness has always resided in the diversity of its people\. Canada has gained immeasurably from the strengths of its people, from the First Nations to the more recent immigrants and refugees who have come to its shores, bringing with them their cultures, traditions and values\. The Somali community in Ontario is part of this legacy\.

By proclaiming the week of June 25 through July 1 as Somali Heritage Week, the Province of Ontario recognizes the economic, political, social and cultural achievements and contributions of Somali Canadians in all aspects of Ontario society\. Like many refugees and immigrants who have made Ontario their home, Somali Canadians are proud to be part of diverse communities across the province\.

This week\-long period covers significant dates in the history of the Somali community\. Somalis from regions throughout the Horn of Africa celebrate their independence during this week, as June 26, June 27 and July 1 mark important anniversaries relating to the independence of these regions\. Today, several celebrations also take place across Ontario during the week of June 25 through July 1 that highlight the rich culture and heritage of the Somali people\. Many of these celebrations reflect the traditions of the Somali people and celebrate independence, liberty and freedom\.

Somali Heritage Week is an opportunity to recognize and reflect on the history and culture of the Somali regions in the Horn of Africa, as well as the significant contributions that Somali Canadians have made and continue to make across Ontario\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Somali Heritage Week

__1 __The week of June 25 through July 1 in each year is proclaimed as Somali Heritage Week\.

__2__ Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

__3__ Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
