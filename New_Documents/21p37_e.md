Preamble

Ontario is home to more than 523,000 people of Polish heritage\. Polish Canadians have lived in Ontario since the 19th century and, over the years, have made significant contributions to Ontario’s society, economy, politics and culture\.

May 3rd is widely celebrated by Polish people around the world to commemorate the 1791 Constitution, which is a symbol of Poland’s aspiration for freedom, democracy and independence\. This is one of the most important Polish holidays and many parades and festivities take place in May\.

By proclaiming the month of May as Polish Heritage Month, the Province of Ontario recognizes the impact that Polish Canadians have had on Ontario's history, culture and democratic institutions\. Polish Heritage Month is an opportunity to educate Ontarians of all ages about the hardships and struggles that Polish Canadians have endured to live in a free and democratic society that respects human rights and the rule of law\. These core values have contributed to the strength and diversity of Ontario\.

Therefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Polish Heritage Month

__1 __The month of May in each year is proclaimed as Polish Heritage Month\.

__2 __Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

__3 __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
