Preamble

Trans people in Ontario face not only indifference, prejudice and hatred, but also anti\-trans violence\. 

By proclaiming November 20 in each year as the Trans Day of Remembrance, the Province of Ontario publicly mourns and honours the lives of those who might otherwise be forgotten and gives trans people and their allies a chance to stand together in vigil\. The Trans Day of Remembrance is an opportunity to raise public awareness of hate crimes committed against trans people\. 

By observing a moment of silence, we express our respect for trans people in the face of indifference, prejudice and hatred and memorialize those who have died as a result of anti\-trans violence\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Trans Day of Remembrance

Moment of silence

__2 __\(1\)  At 10:29 a\.m\. on each Trans Day of Remembrance, the members of the Assembly shall pause and observe one minute of silence in honour of trans people who have died as a result of anti\-trans violence\.

\(2\)  If the Assembly is not sitting on November 20, the members shall pause and observe the moment of silence at 10:29 a\.m\. on the next Thursday that the Assembly is sitting\. 

3 Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.
