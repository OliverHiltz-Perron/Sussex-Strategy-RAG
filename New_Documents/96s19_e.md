<a id="BK0"></a>Definitions and Administration

Purpose

<a id="BK1"></a>__1 __The purpose of this Act is to facilitate the administration of designated Acts named in the Schedule by delegating to designated administrative authorities certain powers and duties relating to the administration of those Acts\.  1996, c\. 19, s\. 1\.

Definitions

<a id="BK2"></a>__2 __In this Act,

“administrative agreement” in relation to a designated administrative authority means an agreement that the Minister has entered into with the administrative authority with respect to the designated legislation for which the administration is delegated to the administrative authority; \(“accord d’application”\)

“administrative authority” means a not\-for\-profit corporation without share capital incorporated under the laws of Ontario but that does not form part of the Government of Ontario, any other government or an agency of a government; \(“organisme d’application”\)

“designated administrative authority” means an administrative authority that the Lieutenant Governor in Council has designated under subsection 3 \(2\); \(“organisme d’application désigné”\)

“designated legislation” means legislation that is an Act named in the Schedule, a regulation made under that Act or provisions of that Act or that regulation, where the Lieutenant Governor in Council has designated the legislation under subsection 3 \(1\); \(“texte législatif désigné”\)

“Minister” means the Minister responsible for the administration of this Act unless the context indicates otherwise\. \(“ministre”\)\.  1996, c\. 19, s\. 2; 2020, c\. 14, Sched\. 8, s\. 1 \(1\)\.

Note: On a day to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor, section 2 of the Act is amended by adding the following subsection: \(See: 2020, c\. 14, Sched\. 8, s\. 1 \(2\)\)

Transition

\(2\)  Despite the definitions of “administrative authority” and “designated administrative authority” in subsection \(1\), where a corporation incorporated under the laws of Canada was a designated administrative authority immediately before the coming into force of subsection 1 \(1\) of Schedule 8 to the Rebuilding Consumer Confidence Act, 2020, and an extension period is provided for in its administrative agreement,

	\(a\)	the corporation continues to be a designated administrative authority during that period;

	\(b\)	if the corporation is continued under the laws of Ontario during that period, the corporation continues to be a designated administrative authority after the expiration of that period; and

	\(c\)	if the corporation is not continued under the laws of Ontario during that period, its designation as a designated administrative authority is deemed to be revoked immediately upon the expiration of that period\. 2020, c\. 14, Sched\. 8, s\. 1 \(2\)\.

Previous administration

\(5\)  If the administration of designated legislation is delegated to a designated administrative authority, nothing in the delegation invalidates regulations made under the designated legislation, acts of the Minister responsible for the administration of the designated legislation in administering it, appointments made by that Minister under the designated legislation, registrations or any other acts done under the designated legislation that were in force immediately before the delegation\.  1996, c\. 19, s\. 3 \(5\)\.

Persons bound

\(6\)  If the administration of designated legislation is delegated to a designated administrative authority, the legislation binds all persons whom it would bind if the administration of it had not been delegated\.  1996, c\. 19, s\. 3 \(6\)\.
