ss\. 16, 17 not to apply to administrators of personal estate only

\(7\)  Section 16 and this section do not apply to an administrator where the letters of administration are limited to the personal property, exclusive of the real property, and do not derogate from any right possessed by a personal representative independent of this Act, but an executor shall not exercise the powers conferred by this section until the executor has obtained probate of the will except with the approval of a judge\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. E\.22, s\. 17 \(7\)\.

Conveyance by personal representative without an order

	\(b\)	although such liability has applied and shall apply as aforesaid in respect of real property so conveyed, divided or distributed, any such purchaser, in good faith and for value, shall be deemed to have had and to have a right to relief over against the persons beneficially entitled, and where such conveyance, division or distribution was made by the personal representative with knowledge of the debt in respect of which claim is made, or without due advertisement for creditors, then against such personal representative; and that

	\(c\)	upon the expiration of such three\-year period where no certificate of pending action or caution has been registered, subsection 21 \(2\) and section 23 apply as if such real property had become vested in the person beneficially entitled thereto under section 9\.
