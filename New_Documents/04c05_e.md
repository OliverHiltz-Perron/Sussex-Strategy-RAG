Preamble

<a id="BK0"></a>The people of Ontario and their Government:

Recognize that Medicare – our system of publicly funded health services – reflects fundamental Canadian values and that its preservation is essential for the health of Ontarians now and in the future;

Confirm their enduring commitment to the principles of public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, portability and accessibility as provided in the Canada Health Act;

Continue to support the prohibition of two\-tier medicine, extra billing and user fees in accordance with the Canada Health Act;

Believe in a consumer\-centred health system that ensures access is based on assessed need, not on an individual’s ability to pay;

Recognize that pharmacare for catastrophic drug costs is important to the future of the health system;

Recognize that access to community based health care, including primary health care, home care based on assessed need and community mental health care are cornerstones of an effective health care system;

Believe in public accountability to demonstrate that the health system is governed and managed in a way that reflects the public interest and that promotes efficient delivery of high quality health services to all Ontarians;

Recognize that the promotion of health, and the prevention of and treatment of disease includes mental and physical illness;

Affirm that a strong health system depends on collaboration between the community, individuals, health service providers and governments, and a common vision of shared responsibility;

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:
