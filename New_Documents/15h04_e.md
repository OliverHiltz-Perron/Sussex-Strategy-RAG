Preamble

Ontario is home to more than 400,000 first\-, second\- and third\-generation Canadians of Hispanic origin\. As early as 1914, Canadians who originated from the 23 Hispanic countries began immigrating to the province and today the Hispanic community is one of the fastest growing in Ontario\. Hispanic\-Canadians represent a dynamic community that has made significant contributions to the growth and prosperity of the Province of Ontario\. 

October is a significant month for the Hispanic community\. Each year, during the month of October, peoples of Hispanic origin around the world come together and pay tribute to their shared culture\. Celebrations are held around the world, such as Hispanic Day \(Dia de la Hispanidad\), the Day of the Cultures \(Dia de las Culturas\), Day of the Race \(Dia de la Raza\), Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity \(Dia del Respeto a la Diversidad Cultural\), Day of Indigenous Resistance \(Dia de la Resistencia Indigena\), and the commemoration of Hispanic Heritage Month in North America\. In 2014, the City of Toronto joined in this commemoration and officially named October as Hispanic Heritage Month\.

By proclaiming the month of October as Hispanic Heritage Month in Ontario, the province recognizes the rich contributions of Hispanic\-Canadians to our social, economic, political and multicultural fabric\. Hispanic Heritage Month is an opportunity to remember, celebrate and educate future generations about the outstanding achievements and contributions of Hispanic people in the province\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Hispanic Heritage Month

	__1\.__  The month of October in each year is proclaimed as Hispanic Heritage Month\.

	2\.  Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

	__3\.__  Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
