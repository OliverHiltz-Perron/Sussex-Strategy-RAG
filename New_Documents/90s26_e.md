Permitted use of audio\-visual communication technology

\(3\)  A requirement in clause \(2\) \(b\) or \(c\) that witnesses be in the presence of the testator or in one another’s presence for the making or acknowledgment of a signature on a will or for the subscribing of a will may be satisfied through the use of audio\-visual communication technology, if,

<a id="BK7"></a>__5__ \(1\) A person who is,

	\(a\)	a member of the Canadian Forces placed on active service under the *National Defence Act* \(Canada\);

	\(b\)	a member of any other naval, land or air force while on active service; or

	\(c\)	a sailor when at sea or in the course of a voyage,

may make a will by a writing signed by him or her or by some other person in his or her presence and by his or her direction without any further formality or any requirement of the presence of or attestation or signature by a witness\.

Certificate of active service

\(2\) For the purposes of this section, a certificate purporting to be signed by or on behalf of an officer having custody of the records certifying that he or she has custody of the records of the force in which a person was serving at the time the will was made, setting out that the person was on active service at that time, is proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, of that fact\.

Where certificate not available

\(3\) For the purposes of this section, if a certificate under subsection \(2\) is not available, a member of a naval, land or air force is deemed to be on active service after he or she has taken steps under the orders of a superior officer preparatory to serving with or being attached to or seconded to a component of such a force that has been placed on active service\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 5\.

Position of signature

<a id="BK9"></a>__7__ \(1\) In so far as the position of the signature is concerned, a will, whether holograph or not, is valid if the signature of the testator made either by him or her or the person signing for him or her is placed at, after, following, under or beside or opposite to the end of the will so that it is apparent on the face of the will that the testator intended to give effect by the signature to the writing signed as his or her will\.

Idem

\(2\) A will is not rendered invalid by the circumstance that,

	\(a\)	the signature does not follow or is not immediately after the end of the will;

	\(b\)	a blank space intervenes between the concluding words of the will and the signature;

	\(c\)	the signature,

	\(i\)	is placed among the words of a testimonium clause or of a clause of attestation,

	\(ii\)	follows or is after or under a clause of attestation either with or without a blank space intervening, or

	\(iii\)	follows or is after, under or beside the name of a subscribing witness;

	\(d\)	the signature is on a side, page or other portion of the paper or papers containing the will on which no clause, paragraph or disposing part of the will is written above the signature; or

	\(e\)	there appears to be sufficient space on or at the bottom of the preceding side, page or other portion of the same paper on which the will is written to contain the signature\.

Idem

\(3\) The generality of subsection \(1\) is not restricted by the enumeration of circumstances set out in subsection \(2\), but a signature in conformity with section 4, 5 or 6 or this section does not give effect to,

	\(a\)	a disposition or direction that is underneath the signature or that follows the signature; or

	\(b\)	a disposition or direction inserted after the signature was made\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 7\.

Wills by minors

<a id="BK10"></a>__8__ \(1\) A will made by a person who is under the age of eighteen years is not valid unless at the time of making the will the person,

	\(b\)	is contemplating marriage and the will states that it is made in contemplation of marriage to a named person except that such a will is not valid unless and until the marriage to the named person takes place;

	\(c\)	is a member of a component of the Canadian Forces,

	\(i\)	that is referred to in the *National Defence Act* \(Canada\) as a regular force, or

	\(ii\)	while placed on active service under the *National Defence Act* \(Canada\); or

	\(d\)	is a sailor and at sea or in the course of a voyage\.

Certificate of active service

\(2\) A certificate purporting to be signed by or on behalf of an officer having custody of the records certifying that he or she has custody of the records of the force in which a person was serving at the time the will was made, setting out that the person was at that time a member of a regular force or was on active service within clause \(1\) \(c\), is proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, of that fact\.

Revocation

\(3\) A person who has made a will under subsection \(1\) may, while under the age of eighteen years, revoke the will\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 8\.

Exercise of appointments by will

<a id="BK11"></a>__9__ No appointment made by will in exercise of any power is valid unless the appointment is executed in the manner hereinbefore required, and every will executed in the manner hereinbefore required is, so far as respects the execution and attestation thereof, a valid execution of a power of appointment by will, despite the fact that it has been expressly required that a will made in exercise of such power shall be executed with some additional or other form of execution or solemnity\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 9\.

Publication unnecessary

<a id="BK12"></a>__10__ A will made in accordance with this Part is valid without other publication\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 10\.

Effect of incompetency of witness

<a id="BK13"></a>__11__ Where a person who attested a will was at the time of its execution or afterward has become incompetent as a witness to prove its execution, the will is not on that account invalid\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 11\.

Witness etc\., beneficiary from will

Bequests to witness void

<a id="BK14"></a>__12 __\(1\)  Where a will is attested by a person to whom or to whose then spouse a beneficial devise, bequest or other disposition or appointment of or affecting property, except charges and directions for payment of debts, is thereby given or made, the devise, bequest or other disposition or appointment is void so far only as it concerns,

	\(a\)	the person so attesting;

	\(b\)	the spouse; or

	\(c\)	a person claiming under either of them,

but the person so attesting is a competent witness to prove the execution of the will or its validity or invalidity\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 12 \(1\)\.

Where will signed for testator by another person

\(2\)  Where a will is signed for the testator by another person in accordance with section 4, to whom or to whose then spouse a beneficial devise, bequest or other disposition or appointment of or affecting property, except charges and directions for payment of debts, is thereby given or made, the devise, bequest, or other disposition is void so far only as it concerns,

	\(a\)	the person so signing;

	\(b\)	the spouse; or

	\(c\)	a person claiming under either of them,

but the will is not invalid for that reason\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 12 \(2\)\.

Where no undue influence

\(3\)  Despite anything in this section, where the Superior Court of Justice is satisfied that neither the person so attesting or signing for the testator nor the spouse exercised any improper or undue influence upon the testator, the devise, bequest or other disposition or appointment is not void\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 12 \(3\); 2006, c\. 19, Sched\. C, s\. 1 \(1\)\.

Exception

\(4\)  Where a will is attested by at least two persons who are not within subsection \(1\) or where no attestation is necessary, the devise, bequest or other disposition or appointment is not void under that subsection\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 12 \(4\)\.

Creditor as witness

<a id="BK15"></a>__13__ Where property is charged by a will with a debt and a creditor or the spouse of a creditor whose debt is so charged attests a will, the person so attesting, despite the charge, is a competent witness to prove the execution of the will or its validity or invalidity\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 13\.

Executor as witness

<a id="BK16"></a>__14__ A person is not incompetent as a witness to prove the execution of a will or its validity or invalidity solely because he or she is an executor\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.26, s\. 14\.
