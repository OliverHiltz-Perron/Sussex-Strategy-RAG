Director may require filing

<a id="BK12"></a>__12 __\(1\)  Where the Director is satisfied that a charge presented for registration contains terms that should be filed under subsection 8 \(1\) because of the frequency of their use in charges in favour of the chargee, the Director may give the chargee notice in the form and manner required by the Director that on and after a day specified by the Director, no charge in favour of the chargee that sets the terms out expressly shall be registered without the Director’s authorization\.
