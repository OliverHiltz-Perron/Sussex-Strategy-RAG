SINGLE FRONT TOWNSHIPS

Single front township, lost corners, etc\.

<a id="BK19"></a>__17 __\(1\)  In this Part,

“single front township” means a township where the usual practice in the original survey was to survey the township boundaries, the proof lines and the base lines, if any, and the concession lines for the fronts of the concessions and to establish the lot corners on the front of each concession\.

Re\-establishment of lost corners, etc\.

\(2\)  A surveyor in re\-establishing a lost corner or obliterated boundary in a single front township shall obtain the best evidence available respecting the corner or boundary, but if the corner or boundary cannot be re\-established in its original position from such evidence, the surveyor shall proceed as follows:

	1\.	If the lost corner is a corner of the township, the surveyor shall report the circumstances to the Minister who shall instruct the surveyor how to proceed\.

	2\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a lot on a township boundary or on the front of a concession, the surveyor shall determine the distance between the two nearest undisputed corners, one being on either side of the lost corner, and the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by dividing the distance proportionately as intended in the original survey having due regard for any road allowance made in the original survey\.

	3\.	If a part of a township boundary, base line or concession line is obliterated, the surveyor shall re\-establish the same by joining the nearest ascertainable points thereof as intended in the original survey\.

	4\.	If a side line of a lot was surveyed as a proof line and part of the side line is obliterated, the surveyor shall re\-establish the side line by joining the nearest ascertainable points thereof as intended in the original survey\.

	5\.	If the front line of a concession is obliterated beyond the last ascertainable point in a concession broken by a lake or river at its end, the surveyor shall re\-establish such concession line on the same astronomic course as shown on the original plan and field notes from the last ascertainable point on the concession line\.

	6\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a lot that is beyond the last undisputed corner on the front of a concession broken by a lake or river at its end, the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by measuring along the front of the concession the distance shown on the original plan and field notes from the last undisputed corner\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.30, s\. 17\.

Fronts of concessions

<a id="BK20"></a>__18 __The front of a concession in a single front township is the boundary of the concession that is nearest the boundary of the township from which the concessions therein are numbered or lettered\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.30, s\. 18\.

Concession line not surveyed or obliterated

<a id="BK21"></a>__19 __Where in a single front township the whole of the front boundary of a concession was not surveyed in the original survey or is obliterated, a surveyor in establishing or re\-establishing such front boundary in whole or in part shall establish or re\-establish such boundary to give the lots in each of the adjacent concessions a depth proportionate to that intended in the original survey\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.30, s\. 19\.

Concession not surveyed in original township, side lines established

<a id="BK22"></a>__20 __Where the front of a concession in a single front township was not surveyed in the original survey, the side lines of the lots in such concession shall be surveyed from the corners of the lots on the front of the concession to the rear thereof to the depth of the concession, that is, to the proportionate depth intended in the original survey as shown on the original plan and field notes having due regard for any road allowance made in the original survey, and the straight line joining the ends of the lot lines so surveyed is the boundary of such concession\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.30, s\. 20\.

Establishment of side lines

<a id="BK23"></a>__21 __A surveyor in establishing in a concession in a single front township a side line of a lot that was not surveyed in the original survey shall proceed as follows:

	1\.	If intended in the original survey, the surveyor shall establish the side line on the same astronomic course as the boundary line of the concession at the end from which the lots are numbered, or, if such boundary line was not surveyed in the original survey because it was wholly broken by a lake or river and if intended in the original survey, the surveyor shall establish the side line on the same astronomic course as the boundary line at the other end of the concession, but where a proof line was surveyed in the original survey, the surveyor shall establish the side line on the side of the proof line that is farthest from the end of the concession that is intended to govern the course of the side line on the same astronomic course as the proof line\.

	2\.	If not intended to be established on the same astronomic course as the boundary line at either end of the concession and if intended in the original survey, the surveyor shall establish the side line at the angle with the boundary line at the end of the concession from which the lots are numbered as shown on the original plan and field notes, or, if such end was not surveyed in the original survey because it was wholly broken by a lake or river and if intended in the original survey, the surveyor shall establish the side line at the angle with the boundary line at the other end of the concession as shown on the original plan and field notes, but where a proof line was surveyed in the original survey, the surveyor shall establish the side line on the side of the proof line that is farthest from the end of the concession that is intended to govern the course of the side line on the same astronomic course as the proof line\.

	3\.	If the end boundaries of a concession were not surveyed in the original survey because they were wholly broken by a lake or river, the surveyor shall establish the side line at such angle with the front boundary of the concession as shown on the original plan and field notes, or, if parts of the front boundary of the concession have been surveyed on different courses, the surveyor shall establish the side line at such angle with the course of each of the parts as shown on the original plan and field notes, or, if such angle is not shown on the original plan and field notes, the surveyor shall establish the side line at such angle with the front boundary of the concession as the Minister may direct\.

	4\.	If the end boundaries of the concession were not surveyed in the original survey because they were wholly broken by a lake or river and a proof line was surveyed in the original survey, the surveyor shall establish the side line on the same astronomic course as the proof line\.

	5\.

DOUBLE FRONT TOWNSHIPS

Double front township, lost corners, etc\.

<a id="BK27"></a>__24 __\(1\)  In this Part,

“double front township” means a township where the usual practice in the original survey was to survey the township boundaries, the proof lines and base lines, if any, and the concession lines forming the front boundaries of the half lots and to establish the front corners of the half lots\.

Re\-establishment of lost corners, etc\.

\(2\)  A surveyor in re\-establishing a lost corner or obliterated boundary in a double front township shall obtain the best evidence available respecting the corner or boundary, but if the corner or boundary cannot be re\-established in its original position from such evidence, the surveyor shall proceed as follows:

	1\.	If the lost corner is a corner of the township, the surveyor shall report the circumstances to the Minister who shall instruct the surveyor how to proceed\.

	2\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a lot on a township boundary or on a concession line, the surveyor shall determine the distance between the two nearest undisputed corners, one being on either side of the lost corner, and the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by dividing the distance proportionately as intended in the original survey having due regard for any road allowance made in the original survey, but where there is an undisputed corner on the other side of the road allowance opposite the lost corner, the surveyor shall re\-establish the lost corner from the position of the undisputed corner, and where the corner on the opposite side of the road allowance is also lost but the position of the original post on the centre line of the road allowance can be determined, such position shall be used in re\-establishing the lost corner\.

	3\.	If a part of a township boundary, base line or concession line is obliterated, the surveyor shall re\-establish the same by joining the nearest ascertainable points thereof as intended in the original survey\.

	4\.	If a side line of a lot was surveyed as a proof line and part of the side line is obliterated, the surveyor shall re\-establish the side line by joining the nearest ascertainable points thereof as intended in the original survey\.

	5\.	If the concession line forming the front boundary of the half lots in a concession is obliterated beyond the last ascertainable point in a concession broken by a lake or river at its end, the surveyor shall re\-establish such concession line on the same astronomic course as shown on the original plan and field notes from the last ascertainable point on the concession line\.

	6\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a lot that is beyond the last undisputed corner on a concession line forming the front boundary of the half lots in a concession broken by a lake or river at its end, the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by measuring along such concession line the distance shown on the original plan and field notes from the last undisputed corner\.

Sectional township with double fronts, lost corners, etc\.

<a id="BK35"></a>__31 __\(1\)  In this Part, 

“sectional township with double fronts” means a township divided into sections and lots where the usual practice in the original survey was to survey the township boundaries, concession lines and side lines of sections defining section boundaries and to establish the front corners of the lots and the section corners\.

Re\-establishment of lost corners, etc\.

\(2\)  A surveyor in re\-establishing a lost corner or obliterated boundary in a sectional township with double fronts shall obtain the best evidence available respecting the corner or boundary, but if the corner or boundary cannot be re\-established in its original position from such evidence, the surveyor shall proceed as follows:

	1\.	If the lost corner is a corner of the township, the surveyor shall report the circumstances to the Minister who shall instruct the surveyor how to proceed\.

	2\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a section on a township boundary, the surveyor shall determine the distance between the two nearest undisputed corners, one being on either side of the lost corner, and the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by dividing the distance proportionately as intended in the original survey having due regard for any road allowance made in the original survey\.

	3\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a section and the concession line in front of the adjacent sections on either side of the lost corner is shown on the original plan and field notes as a straight line and the side lines between such sections and adjacent sections on the opposite side of the concession line are shown on the original plan and field notes as a straight line and the adjacent corners of the sections are lost, the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by intersecting a straight line joining the nearest ascertainable points on the concession line with a straight line joining the nearest ascertainable points on the side line of the section on opposite sides of the concession line, but where such ascertainable points on the side line of the sections are more than 400 metres apart, the surveyor shall determine the distance between the two nearest undisputed corners on the concession line, one being on either side of the lost corner, and the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by dividing the distance proportionately as intended in the original survey having due regard for any road allowance made in the original survey and by joining with a straight line the nearest ascertainable points on the concession line\.

	7\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a lot in a section on a front of a concession, the surveyor shall determine the distance between the two nearest undisputed corners in the section, one being on either side of the lost corner, and the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by dividing the distance proportionately as intended in the original survey having due regard for any road allowance made in the original survey, but where there is an undisputed corner on the other side of the road allowance, opposite the lost corner, the surveyor shall re\-establish the lost corner from the position of the undisputed corner, and where the corner on the opposite side of the road allowance is also lost but the position of the original post on the centre line of the road allowance can be determined, such position shall be used in re\-establishing the lost corner\.

	8\.	If a part of a township boundary is obliterated, the surveyor shall re\-establish it by joining the nearest ascertainable points thereof as intended in the original survey\.

	9\.	If part of a concession line or side line of a section surveyed in the original survey is obliterated between the corners of a section, the surveyor shall re\-establish it by joining the nearest ascertainable points thereof as intended in the original survey\.

	10\.	If a concession line is obliterated beyond the last side line of a section in a concession broken by a lake or river at its end, the surveyor shall re\-establish it on the astronomic course shown on the original plan and field notes from the nearest ascertainable point on the concession line in that section\.

SECTIONAL TOWNSHIPS WITH SINGLE FRONTS

Sectional township with single fronts, lost corners, etc\.

<a id="BK42"></a>__37 __\(1\)  In this Part,

“sectional township with single fronts” means a township divided into sections and lots where the usual practice in the original survey was to survey the township boundaries, concession lines and side lines of the sections and to establish the front corners of the lots and the section corners\.

Re\-establishment of lost corners, etc\.

\(2\)  A surveyor in re\-establishing a lost corner or obliterated boundary in a sectional township with single fronts shall obtain the best evidence available respecting the corner or boundary, but if the corner or boundary cannot be re\-established in its original position from such evidence, the surveyor shall proceed as follows:

	1\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a township, the surveyor shall report the circumstances to the Minister who shall instruct the surveyor how to proceed\.

	2\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a section on a township boundary, the surveyor shall determine the distance between the two nearest undisputed corners, one being on either side of the lost corner, and the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by dividing the distance proportionately as intended in the original survey\.

	3\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a section and the concession line in front of the adjoining sections on either side of the lost corner is shown on the original plan and field notes as a straight line and the side lines between such sections and adjoining sections on the opposite side of the concession line are shown on the original plan and field notes as a straight line, the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by intersecting a straight line joining the nearest ascertainable points on the concession line with a straight line joining the nearest ascertainable points on the side line of the section on opposite sides of the concession line, but where such ascertainable points on the side line of the sections are more than 400 metres apart, the surveyor shall determine the distance between the two nearest undisputed corners on the concession line, one being on either side of the lost corner, and the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by dividing the distance proportionately as intended in the original survey and by joining with a straight line the nearest ascertainable points on the concession line\.

	4\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a section and the concession line in front of the adjoining sections on either side of the lost corner is shown on the original plan and field notes as a straight line and the side lines between such sections and adjoining sections on the opposite side of the concession are shown on the original plan and field notes not as a straight line, the surveyor shall determine the distance between the two nearest undisputed corners on the concession line, one being on either side of the lost corner, and the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by dividing the distance proportionately as intended in the original survey and by joining with a straight line the nearest ascertainable points on the concession line\.

	5\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a section and the concession line in front of the adjoining sections on either side of the lost corner is shown on the original plan and field notes not as a straight line and the side lines between such sections and adjoining sections on the opposite side of the concession line are shown on the original plan and field notes as a straight line, the surveyor shall determine the distance between the two nearest undisputed corners on the side lines of the sections, one being on either side of the lost corner, and the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by dividing the distance proportionately as intended in the original survey and by joining with a straight line the nearest ascertainable points on the side line of the section\.

	6\.	If the lost corner is the corner of a section and the concession line in front of the adjoining sections on either side of the lost corner is shown on the original plan and field notes not as a straight line and the side lines between such sections and adjoining sections on the opposite sides of the concession line are shown on the original plan and field notes not as a straight line, the surveyor shall report the circumstances to the Minister who shall instruct the surveyor how to proceed\.

	7\.	If the lost corner is a corner of a lot in a section on the front of a concession, the surveyor shall determine the distance between the two nearest undisputed corners in the section, one being on either side of the lost corner, and the surveyor shall re\-establish the corner by dividing the distance proportionately as intended in the original survey\.

	8\.	If a part of a township boundary is obliterated, the surveyor shall re\-establish it by joining the nearest ascertainable points thereof in the manner intended in the original survey\.

	9\.	If part of a concession line or side line of a section surveyed in the original survey is obliterated between the corners of a section, the surveyor shall re\-establish it by joining the nearest ascertainable points thereof as intended in the original survey\.

	10\.	If a concession line is obliterated beyond the last side line of a section in a concession broken by a lake or river at its end, the surveyor shall establish it on the astronomic course shown on the original plan and field notes from the nearest ascertainable point on the concession line in that section\.

	11\.	If in a concession wholly or partly broken by a lake or river on its front a side line of a section is obliterated and it was not surveyed across the lake or river, the surveyor shall establish it on the astronomic course shown on the original plan and field notes from the nearest ascertainable point thereof\.

Application

	2\.	If the front of a concession in a section is partly or wholly broken by a lake or river and no post was planted in the original survey on the banks of the lake or river to regulate the widths in front of the broken lots and the original field notes show that a survey line was run across the lake or river to regulate the widths in front of the broken lots, the surveyor shall establish the side line of such broken lots in accordance with this section from a point on the section limit fronting the concession determined by dividing proportionately as intended in the original survey the distance between the corners of the section\.

	3\.	If the front of a concession in a section is wholly broken by a lake or river and no post was planted in the original survey on the banks of the lake or river to regulate the widths in front of the broken lots and the original field notes do not show that a survey line was run in the original survey across the lake or river to regulate the widths in front of the broken lots, the surveyor shall establish the side line of such broken lots in accordance with this section from the front corner of the lots in the concession to the rear thereof\.

	4\.	If the end of a concession is broken on its front and rear by a lake or river and no posts were planted on the banks of the lake or river to regulate the widths of the lots and the original field notes do not show that a survey line was run in the original survey to regulate the widths in front of the broken lots, the surveyor shall establish the side lines of any such lot in accordance with this section from points determined by measuring the distance intended in the original survey from the nearest undisputed corner along the astronomic course intended in the original survey for the front of the concession\.
