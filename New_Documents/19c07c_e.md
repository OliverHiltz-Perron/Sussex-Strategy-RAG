Exception, other immunity provisions

\(2\)  Despite subsection \(1\), in the case of a conflict between a provision of this Act and a provision in any other Act respecting limits on the liability of the Crown or an officer, employee or agent of the Crown, the provision that provides the greater protection against such liability prevails, unless the other Act expressly provides otherwise\.

<a id="BK8"></a>Crown Liability

Crown liability

<a id="BK9"></a>__8 __\(1\)  Except as otherwise provided under this Act or any other Act, the Crown is subject to all the liabilities in tort to which it would be liable if it were a person,

Same

\(2\)  For greater certainty, nothing in clause \(1\) \(a\) subjects the Crown to liability for a tort that is not attributable to the acts or omissions of an officer, employee or agent of the Crown\.

Limitation of government actors’ liability applies to the Crown

\(3\)  The negation or limitation under an Act of the liability of an officer, employee or agent of the Crown in respect of a tort committed by him or her applies to the same extent and in the same manner with respect to the Crown, and no proceeding may be brought against the Crown in respect of an act or omission of an officer, employee or agent of the Crown if a proceeding in tort in respect of such an act or omission may not be brought against that officer, employee or agent or against his or her personal representative\.

Same

\(2\)  Property that vests in the Crown as a result of the dissolution of a corporation by the Crown is property that vests in the Crown independent of the Crown’s acts or intentions within the meaning of subsection \(1\)\.

No liability in tort

\(3\)  Where property vests in the Crown in the manner described in subsection \(1\), the Crown is not liable in tort by reason of any act or omission of the Crown or anyone acting on its behalf or with its approval related to any of the following purposes or a purpose that is similar to any of the following purposes:

	1\.	Investigating, securing, maintaining or managing the property\.

	2\.	Restoring the property to productive use, responding to complaints or preserving public health and safety\.

	3\.	Exercising any authority in respect of the property under the Escheats Act, 2015 or the Forfeited Corporate Property Act, 2015\.

	\(b\)	in the case of land, has registered a notice against the title to the property that it intends to use the property for Crown purposes\.

Notice

\(5\)  Registration of the Crown on title under subsection 12 \(1\) of the Forfeited Corporate Property Act, 2015 or any registration on title to land by the Public Guardian and Trustee is not notice for the purposes of clause \(4\) \(b\)\.

Leave to proceed required, automatic stay 

\(2\)  A proceeding to which this section applies that is brought on or after the day section 1 of Schedule 7 to the Smarter and Stronger Justice Act, 2020 comes into force may proceed only with leave of the court and, unless and until leave is granted, is deemed to have been stayed in respect of all claims in that proceeding from the time that it is brought\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Documents on motion for leave

\(3\)  On a motion for leave under subsection \(2\), the claimant shall, in accordance with section 15 if applicable, serve on the defendant and file with the court,

Response by defendant

	\(a\)	the proceeding is being brought in good faith; and

	\(b\)	there is a reasonable possibility that the claim described in subsection \(1\) would be resolved in the claimant’s favour\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Costs

\(8\)  Each party to the motion for leave shall bear its own costs of the motion\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Effect of granting leave

\(9\)  The granting of leave under subsection \(2\) lifts the stay of the proceeding\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Effect of refusing leave

\(10\)  If leave is not granted under subsection \(2\), 

	\(a\)	the proceeding is rendered a nullity; or

	\(b\)	if the proceeding contains any claims other than the claim described in subsection \(1\), the proceeding is rendered a nullity in respect of the claim described in that subsection and the stay is lifted with respect to the remainder of the proceeding\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Waiver of leave requirement

\(11\)  Despite subsections \(2\) and \(10\), the Crown may waive the application of subsection \(2\) in relation to a proceeding by giving notice of the waiver in writing to the claimant\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Same

\(12\)  The Crown may exercise its discretion under subsection \(11\) at any time before the hearing of a motion for leave under subsection \(2\), including before an intended proceeding is brought\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Same

\(13\)  If the Crown exercises its discretion under subsection \(11\) after a proceeding has been brought, 

	\(a\)	the stay of the proceeding is lifted once notice of the waiver is given to the claimant; and 

	\(b\)	the Crown shall give notice of the waiver in writing to the court\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Non\-application to Crown claimant

\(14\)  This section does not apply if the claimant is the Crown\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Transition

\(15\)  This section, as it read immediately before the day section 1 of Schedule 7 to the Smarter and Stronger Justice Act, 2020 came into force, continues to apply with respect to a proceeding for which a motion for leave was made under this section before that day, except that the Crown may, at any time before the hearing of the motion, waive the requirement for leave by giving notice of the waiver in writing to the claimant and to the court\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Same

\(16\)  For greater certainty, if a proceeding for which leave was required under this section was brought without leave before the day section 1 of Schedule 7 to the Smarter and Stronger Justice Act, 2020 came into force, the proceeding was a nullity in respect of the claim described in subsection \(1\) from the time the proceeding was brought\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Same

\(17\)  For the purposes of any applicable limitation period,

	\(a\)	a proceeding to which subsection \(15\) applies shall be considered to have been commenced in respect of the claim described in subsection \(1\) when the motion for leave was made, despite any waiver of the leave requirement by the Crown; and

	\(b\)	a proceeding to which subsection \(16\) applies shall, despite being a nullity in respect of the claim described in subsection \(1\), be considered to have been commenced when the proceeding was brought\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 1\.

Notice of claim for damages required

<a id="BK20"></a>__18 __\(1\)  No proceeding that includes a claim for damages may be brought against the Crown unless, at least 60 days before the commencement of the proceeding, the claimant serves on the Crown, in accordance with section 15, notice of the claim containing sufficient particulars to identify the occasion out of which the claim arose\. 2019, c\. 7, Sched\. 17, s\. 18 \(1\)\.

Extension of applicable limitation period

\(3\)  If a notice of claim is served under subsection \(1\) before the expiry of a limitation period applicable with respect to the claim but the 60\-day period referred to in that subsection ends after the expiry of the limitation period, the limitation period is extended to the last instant of the seventh day following the end of the 60\-day period\. 2019, c\. 7, Sched\. 17, s\. 18 \(3\)\.

Exception, breach of duty respecting property

\(4\)  Despite subsection \(1\), no proceeding that includes a claim for damages may be brought against the Crown under clause 8 \(1\) \(b\) unless the notice required by subsection \(1\) is served on the Crown in accordance with section 15 no later than 10 days after the occurrence of the event out of which the claim arises\. 2019, c\. 7, Sched\. 17, s\. 18 \(4\)\.

\(6\)  For greater certainty, failure to give notice of a claim as required by this section renders a proceeding brought without such notice a nullity in respect of the claim, from the time the proceeding is brought\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 2\.

Same

\(7\)  Subsection \(6\) applies with respect to a proceeding brought before, on or after the day section 2 of Schedule 7 to the Smarter and Stronger Justice Act, 2020 comes into force\. 2020, c\. 11, Sched\. 7, s\. 2\.
