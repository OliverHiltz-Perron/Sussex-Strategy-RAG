Election to purchase credit for benefit in supplemental plan

\(8\)  A member may elect to purchase credit for a benefit in a supplemental plan described in paragraph 8 of subsection \(3\) only if,

	\(b\)	the only reason that the total amount of the contributions payable by the employer does not equal the total amount of the contributions payable by the employer’s employees is because one or more employees made contributions to a supplemental plan in respect of pensionable service described in paragraph 8 of subsection 11 \(3\)\.  2006, c\. 2, s\. 12 \(3\)\.

Cap on contributions by employer for increased benefits

Same

Exception

\(2\)  Subsection \(1\) does not apply with respect to an amendment that is required to comply with a federal or provincial law or an amendment that does not increase going concern liabilities by more than 1 per cent\.  2006, c\. 2, s\. 15 \(2\)\.
