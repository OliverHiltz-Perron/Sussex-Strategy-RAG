Interpretation and Application

Definitions

__1 __\(1\)  In this Act,

“alternative method” means, with respect to the prevention of serious bodily harm to a patient or to others, a method that imposes less control on the patient than restraining or confining the patient or using a monitoring device on him or her; \(“méthode de rechange”\)

“patient” includes a resident of a facility; \(“malade”\)

“restrain” means, with respect to a person, to place the person under control by the minimal use of such force, mechanical means or chemicals as is reasonable having regard to the person’s physical and mental condition, and “restraint” has a corresponding meaning\. \(“maîtriser”, “contention”\)  2001, c\. 16, s\. 1 \(1\)\.

\(2\)  This Act governs the use of monitoring devices that are used to prevent serious bodily harm to a patient or to others, but not monitoring devices that are used for other diagnostic or treatment purposes\.  2001, c\. 16, s\. 1 \(2\)\.

Application

__2 __\(1\)  This Act applies to every hospital that is approved as a public hospital under the Public Hospitals Act, every hospital that is licensed as a private hospital under the Private Hospitals Act and every facility and organization that is prescribed by regulation as a facility to which this Act applies\.  2001, c\. 16, s\. 2 \(1\)\.

Exception

\(2\)  This Act does not apply in circumstances in which the Mental Health Act governs the use of restraints on patients or other persons in psychiatric facilities\.  2001, c\. 16, s\. 2 \(2\)\.
