Contents of order

Absolute liability

\(10\)  A requirement that a person pay an administrative penalty applies even if,

No admission

\(13\)  If a person pays an administrative penalty in respect of a contravention, the payment is not, for the purposes of any prosecution in respect of the contravention, an admission that the person committed the contravention\. 2019, c\. 14, Sched\. 8, s\. 50\.
