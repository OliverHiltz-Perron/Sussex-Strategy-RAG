Recovery Month Act, 2021

[S\.o\. 2021, chapter 14](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/S21014)

__Consolidation Period:__ From May 12, 2021 to the [e\-Laws currency date](http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/navigation?file=currencyDates&lang=en)\.

No amendments\.

Preamble

By proclaiming the month of September as Recovery Month, the Province of Ontario recognizes that people and families across the province often face challenges related to their addictions and mental health but can recover and be treated effectively\. While leaders and organizations across the global mental health and addictions sector mark September as Recovery Month, the Governments of Canada and Ontario have yet to proclaim this month to recognize and support Ontarians recovering from addiction\.

While Ontario continues its battle against opioid use and addictions, Recovery Month will increase public awareness of the types of addictions Ontarians face every day and encourage people to seek help\. By proclaiming Recovery Month here in Ontario, individuals and families affected by addiction may begin to realize they are not alone, and that there are many people and organizations willing to help them in their recovery journey\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Recovery Month

__1__ The month of September in each year is proclaimed as Recovery Month\.

2 Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

3__ __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
