No amendments\.

Preamble

There are over 8,000 children and youth living under the care of the Crown and of Children’s Aid Societies in Ontario\.

Wards of the Crown and of Children’s Aid Societies were given a voice through “Our Voice, Our Turn: Youth Leaving Care Hearings”, a series of hearings organized by current and former wards of the Province\.  These hearings shed light on the challenges faced by children and youth living under the care of the Province and made it clear that more must be done to support these young people\.

By proclaiming May 14 in each year Children and Youth in Care Day, the Province of Ontario recognizes the enormous contributions that current and former Crown and Society wards make to the Province, as well as the strength, bravery and resilience shown by these children and youth in the face of adversity\.  Children and Youth in Care Day is an opportunity to raise awareness about children and youth under the care of the Province and to recommit to supporting them and helping them reach their full potential\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Children and Youth in Care Day
