Investigation

<a id="BK29"></a>__206 __\(1\)  Where upon a statement made under oath or affirmation it appears probable to the Chief Executive Officer that any corporation or other person has contravened any of the provisions of this Act or the regulations, the Chief Executive Officer by order may appoint any person to make such investigation as the Chief Executive Officer considers expedient for the due administration and enforcement of this Act, and in the order shall determine and prescribe the scope of the investigation\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. L\.25, s\. 206 \(1\); 2018, c\. 8, Sched\. 16, s\. 5\.

Scope of investigation

\(2\)  For the purpose of any investigation ordered under this section, the person appointed to make the investigation may investigate, inquire into and examine,

	\(a\)	the affairs of the person or corporation in respect of whom the investigation is being made and any books, papers, documents, correspondence, communications, negotiations, transactions, investigations, loans, borrowings and payments to, by, on behalf of or in relation to or connected with the corporation or other person and any property, assets or things owned, acquired or alienated in whole or in part by the corporation or other person or by any person or corporation acting on behalf of or as agent for the person or corporation; and

	\(b\)	the assets at any time held, the liabilities, debts, undertakings and obligations at any time existing, the financial or other conditions at any time prevailing in or in relation to or in connection with the corporation or other person and the relationship that may at any time exist or have existed between the corporation or other person and any other person by reason of investments, purchases, commissions promised, secured or paid, interests held or acquired, purchase or sale of stock or other property, the transfer, negotiation or holding of stock, interlocking directorates, common control, undue influence or control or any other relationship\.

\(3\)  The person making an investigation under this section has the same power to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence on oath or otherwise, and to produce documents, records and things, as is vested in the Superior Court of Justice for the trial of civil actions, and the failure or refusal of a person to attend, to answer questions or to produce such documents, records and things as are in the person’s custody or possession makes the person liable to be committed for contempt by a judge of the Superior Court of Justice as if in breach of an order or judgment of the Superior Court of Justice and no provision of the Evidence Act exempts any bank or corporation or any officer or employee thereof from the operation of this section\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. L\.25, s\. 206 \(3\); 2006, c\. 19, Sched\. C, s\. 1 \(1\)\.

Inspection of seized documents

\(6\)  Where any documents, records, securities or other property are seized under subsection \(5\), the documents, records, securities or other property shall be made available for inspection and copying by the corporation or other person from whom seized at a mutually convenient time and place if a request for an opportunity to inspect or copy is made by the person or corporation to the person appointed to make the investigation\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. L\.25, s\. 206 \(6\)\.

Accountants and experts
