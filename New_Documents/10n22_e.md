Preamble

The health and safety of Ontarians is important to the people of Ontario and their government\.  Ontario has the highest per capita use of narcotics and other controlled substances in Canada, some of which is unwarranted and is adversely affecting the health and safety of Ontarians\.  Ontario has seen a significant increase in narcotics\-related deaths and in the need for addiction treatment services\.  Public and private spending on narcotics and other controlled substances has increased out of proportion to that which is medically required\.

In May 2010, the Government of Ontario developed a strategy to address the health and safety concerns related to the use of narcotics and other controlled substances, including a commitment to:

	1\.	Provide for access to narcotics and other monitored drugs when they are medically appropriate to treat pain\.

	2\.	Reduce the abuse and misuse of narcotics and other monitored drugs, including__ __reducing the diversion of narcotics and other monitored drugs from medically appropriate use\.

	3\.	Support treatment for and reduce narcotics\-related addictions and reduce narcotics\-related deaths\.

Monitoring the prescribing and dispensing of narcotics and other monitored drugs is a key tool in the government’s strategy\. The ability to collect, analyze and report on the prescribing and dispensing of narcotics and other monitored drugs will contribute to appropriate prescribing and dispensing practices and help identify and address systemic challenges that may lead to addiction and death\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:
