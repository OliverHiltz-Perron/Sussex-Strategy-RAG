Insertions

\(4\)  A storer may insert in a receipt any other term or condition that,

Contract constituted

\(5\)  Subject to this Act, a warehouse receipt issued by a storer, when delivered to the owner or bailor of the goods or mailed to the latest address of the owner or bailor known to the storer, constitutes the contract between the owner or bailor and the storer; provided that the owner or bailor may within twenty days after such delivery or mailing notify the storer in writing that the owner or bailor does not accept such contract and thereupon the owner or bailor shall remove the goods deposited subject to the storer’s lien for charges and if such notice is not given then the warehouse receipt so delivered or mailed constitutes the contract\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 2 \(5\)\.

R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 4 \(2\)\.

Failure to mark

\(2\)  Where a storer fails to comply with subsection \(1\), a holder of the receipt who purchases it for valuable consideration believing it to be negotiable may, at the holder’s option, treat the receipt as vesting in the holder all rights attaching to a negotiable receipt and imposing upon the storer the same liabilities the storer would have incurred had the receipt been negotiable, and the storer is liable accordingly\.

Conclusiveness of negotiable receipt

R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 11\.

Description of goods in receipt

__12 __Where goods are described in a receipt merely by,

	\(c\)	a statement that the packages containing the goods are said by the depositor to contain goods of a certain kind; or

	\(d\)	a statement of import similar to that of clause \(a\), \(b\) or \(c\),

the statement does not impose any liability on the storer in respect of the nature, kind or quality of the goods, but shall be deemed to be a representation by the storer either that the marks or labels were in fact on the goods or packages, or that the goods were in fact described by the depositor as stated, or that the packages containing the goods were in fact described by the depositor as containing goods of a certain kind, as the case may be\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 12\.

Commingled goods and storer’s liability therefor

__14 __Where authorized by agreement or by custom, a storer may mingle fungible goods with other goods of the same kind and grade, and in that case the holders of the receipts for the mingled goods own the entire mass in common, and each holder is entitled to such proportion thereof as the quantity shown by the holder’s receipt to have been deposited bears to the whole\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 14\.

Attachment or levy upon goods for which a negotiable receipt has been issued

__15 __Where goods are delivered to a storer by the owner or person whose act in conveying the title to them to a purchaser in good faith for value would bind the owner and a negotiable receipt is issued for them, they cannot thereafter while in the possession of the storer, be levied under an execution, unless the receipt is first surrendered to the storer\.

Perishable and hazardous goods

__17 __\(1\)  Where goods are of a perishable nature or by keeping will deteriorate greatly in value or injure other property, the storer may give such notice as is reasonable and possible under the circumstances to the holder of the receipt for the goods, if the name and address of the holder is known to the storer, or if not, then to the depositor, requiring the depositor to satisfy the lien upon the goods and to remove them from the warehouse, and on the failure of such person to satisfy the lien and remove the goods within the time specified in the notice, the storer may sell the goods at public or private sale without advertising\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 17 \(1\)\.

R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 19 \(2\)\.

Idem

R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 19 \(4\)\.

Transfer of receipts

__20 __The goods covered by a non\-negotiable receipt may be transferred by the holder by delivery to a purchaser or donee of the goods of a transfer in writing executed by the holder, but the transfer does not affect or bind the storer until the storer is notified in writing thereof\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 20\.

Rights of person to whom a receipt has been transferred

__21 __\(1\)  A person to whom the goods covered by a non\-negotiable receipt are transferred acquires, as against the transferor,

Rights of person to whom a receipt has been negotiated

__22 __A person to whom a negotiable receipt is duly negotiated acquires,

	\(a\)	such title to the goods as the person negotiating the receipt to the person had or had ability to transfer to a purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration and also such title to the goods as the depositor or person to whose order the goods were to be delivered by the terms of receipt had or had ability to transfer to a purchaser in good faith for valuable consideration; and

	\(b\)	the benefit of the obligation of the storer to hold possession of the goods for the person according to the terms of the receipt as fully as if the storer had contracted directly with the person\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 22\.

Transfer of negotiable receipt without endorsement

__23 __Where a negotiable receipt is transferred for valuable consideration by delivery and the endorsement of the transferor is essential for negotiation, the transferee acquires a right against the transferor to compel the transferor to endorse the receipt, unless a contrary intention appears and the negotiation shall take effect as of the time when the endorsement is made\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 23\.

R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 24\.

Endorser not a guarantor

When negotiation not impaired by fraud, mistake or duress

__26 __The validity of the negotiation of a receipt is not impaired by the fact that the negotiation was a breach of duty on the part of the person making the negotiation, or by the fact that the owner of the receipt was induced by fraud, mistake or duress to entrust the possession or custody of the receipt to such person, if the person to whom the receipt was negotiated, or a person to whom the receipt was subsequently negotiated, paid value therefor without notice of the breach of duty, or fraud, mistake or duress\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 26\.

Subsequent negotiation

__27 __Where a person having sold, mortgaged or pledged goods that are in a warehouse and for which a negotiable receipt has been issued, or having sold, mortgaged or pledged a negotiable receipt representing goods, continues in possession of the negotiable receipt, the subsequent negotiation thereof by that person under any sale or other disposition thereof to any person receiving it in good faith, for valuable consideration and without notice of the previous sale, mortgage or pledge, has the same effect as if a previous purchaser of the goods or receipt had expressly authorized the subsequent negotiation\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 27\.

Negotiation defeats vendor’s lien

__28 __Where a negotiable receipt has been issued for goods, no seller’s lien or right of stoppage in transitu defeats the rights of a purchaser for value in good faith to whom the receipt has been negotiated, whether the negotiation is prior or subsequent to the notification to the storer who issued the receipt of the seller’s claim to a lien or right of stoppage in transitu and the storer shall not deliver the goods to an unpaid seller unless the receipt is first surrendered for cancellation\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. W\.3, s\. 28\.

Where Act not to apply
