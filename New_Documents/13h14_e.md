Hawkins Gignac Act \(Carbon Monoxide Safety\), 2013

S\.o\. 2013, chapter 14

__Consolidation Period:__  From December 12, 2013 to the [e\-Laws currency date](http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/navigation?file=currencyDates&lang=en)\.

No amendments\.

Preamble

Carbon monoxide is known as the silent killer because it is a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas\. This Act is named in honour of the Hawkins family — Laurie, Richard, and their children, Cassandra and Jordan — who were tragically killed by carbon monoxide poisoning in their Woodstock home\.

Reminding Ontarians of the importance of having functioning carbon monoxide detectors can help save lives\. Designating the calendar week beginning on November 1 as Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week aligns the need to check carbon monoxide detectors and appliances with the end of daylight saving time\. Changing the time on clocks and maintaining safety alarms are two necessary tasks that are easy to perform and promote together\. 

As winter approaches, the impetus to begin using gas fired appliances, such as fireplaces, that can produce lethal carbon monoxide increases\. Appliances that are rarely used over the summer months may develop leaks or blockages and cause carbon monoxide to accumulate inside the home\. Therefore, it is important to inspect appliances and carbon monoxide detectors when the colder temperatures begin\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week
