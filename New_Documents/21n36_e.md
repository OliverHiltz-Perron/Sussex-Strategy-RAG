Preamble

Ontario’s non\-profit sector is a major contributor to innovation, job creation and the economy\. Its one million professionals, driven by their mission, are experts in delivering social, economic and environmental solutions, especially at the local community level\. They enrich our quality of life by promoting mental and physical health, social equity, education, the arts, sports and recreation, the environment, child development, senior care and much more\. They serve millions of Ontarians every year in every corner of the province\.

Their work is indispensable and heroic, but it is all too often invisible\. The COVID\-19 pandemic has highlighted the remarkable contributions of the essential services provided by the non\-profit sector, which relies on funding and volunteers\. Their public service deserves to be recognized and honoured\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Non\-Profit Sector Appreciation Week

__1 __The third week in February each year is proclaimed as Non\-Profit Sector Appreciation Week\.

__2 __Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

__3 __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
