Preamble

Paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus, abbreviated as “PANDAS”, is a diagnosis that describes the condition of children or adolescents who have either an abrupt onset of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder or tic disorder or an acute worsening of those symptoms following a streptococcus infection\.

Paediatric acute\-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome, abbreviated as “PANS”, is a term used to describe the cases where the onset of symptoms is linked to infections that include not only streptococcus infections\.

Children and adolescents who suffer from PANDAS or PANS often present a sudden, dramatic change in personality displayed as obsessive compulsive disorder together with other symptoms such as intense fear or anxiety, motor and vocal tics, severely restricted food intake, emotional lability, oppositional and aggressive behaviour, behavioural regression, deterioration in school performance, sensory abnormalities, urinary changes and sleep difficulties following strep, bacterial or viral infection\. Treatment varies by the needs of the patient, but may include antibiotics, steroids, IVIG, plasmapheresis, anti\-inflammatory medication and cognitive behaviour therapy\.

PANDAS and PANS are often misdiagnosed and undertreated as a result of lack of awareness by the public and even by the medical community\. It is imperative that there be greater public awareness of this serious health issue\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

PANDAS/PANS Awareness Day

<a id="s1"></a>	[1\.](http://www.ontario.ca/fr/lois/loi/16p31" \l "s1)__  __October 9 in each year is proclaimed as PANDAS/PANS Awareness Day\.

<a id="s2"></a>	[2\.](http://www.ontario.ca/fr/lois/loi/16p31" \l "s2)  Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

<a id="s3"></a>	[3\.](http://www.ontario.ca/fr/lois/loi/16p31" \l "s3)  Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
