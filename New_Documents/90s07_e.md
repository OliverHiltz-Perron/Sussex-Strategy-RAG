Power to authorize leases of settled estates

__2 __\(1\)  The court, if it considers it proper and consistent with a due regard for the interests of all persons entitled under the settlement, and subject to the provisions and restrictions of this Act, may authorize leases of any settled estate or of any rights or privileges over or affecting any settled estate, for any purpose whatsoever, the following conditions being observed:

When lease to take effect

	1\.	Every such lease shall be made to take effect in possession at or within one year after the making thereof, and shall be for such term of years as the court shall direct, where the court is satisfied that it is beneficial to the inheritance to grant a lease\.

Best rent to be reserved

Exception

	2\.	On every such lease shall be reserved the best rent or reservation in the nature of rent, either uniform or not, that can be reasonably obtained, to be made payable half\-yearly or more often, and to be incident to the immediate reversion; but in the case of a mining lease, a repairing lease or a building lease a nominal rent or any smaller rent than the rent to be ultimately made payable may, if the court thinks fit so to direct, be made payable during all or any part of the first five years of the term of the lease\.

Reservation of rent in leases of earth, coal, stone or mineral

	3\.	Where any such lease is of any earth, coal, stone or mineral a certain portion of the whole rent or payment reserved shall be from time to time set aside and invested, when and so long as the person for the time being entitled to the receipt of the rent is a person who by reason of the person’s estate or by virtue of any declaration in the settlement is entitled to work the earth, coal, stone, or mineral for the person’s own benefit, one\-fourth part of the rent, and in other cases three\-fourth parts thereof, and in every such lease sufficient provision shall be made to ensure such application of that portion of the rent by the appointment of trustees or otherwise, as the court considers expedient\.

Cutting timber

	4\.	No such lease shall authorize the cutting of any timber or the felling of any trees except in the ordinary course of husbandry, or so far as shall in the judgment of the court be necessary, nor shall it be made without impeachment of waste\.

Form of lease

	5\.	Every such lease shall be by deed, in duplicate, executed by the lessor and lessee, and shall be subject to the statutory right of re\-entry for non\-payment of rent contained in the* *Commercial Tenancies Act\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.7, s\. 2 \(1\); 1997, c\. 24, s\. 221 \(1\)\.

What evidence to be produced on an application to authorize leases

__8 __Where application is made to the court either to approve of a particular lease or to vest any power of leasing in trustees, the court shall require the applicant to produce such evidence as it considers sufficient to enable it to ascertain the nature, value and circumstances of the estate and the terms and conditions on which leases thereof ought to be authorized\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.7, s\. 8\.

Direction as to who shall be lessor

__9 __Where a particular lease or contract for a lease has been approved by the court, the court shall direct what person shall execute the same as lessor, and the lease or contract executed by such person shall take effect in all respects as if the person had been at the time of the execution thereof absolutely entitled to the whole estate or interest that is bound by the settlement, and had immediately afterwards settled the same according to the settlement, and so as to operate if necessary by way of revocation and appointment of the use or otherwise as the court directs\.  R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.7, s\. 9\.

When powers of leasing may be vested in trustees

R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.7, s\. 10\.

Conditions that leases be settled by the court

R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.7, s\. 11\.

Striking out such conditions

R\.S\.O\. 1990, c\. S\.7, s\. 26\.

Court may exercise powers repeatedly

Extent of powers

Costs

__31 __The court may order that any costs or expenses of any persons of and incident to any application under this Act shall be a charge on the land that is the subject of the application, or on any other land included in the same settlement and subject to the same limitations, or may direct the same to be paid out of the corpus or income of any fund realized by the sale, mortgage or lease of such estate under this Act, and the court may also direct that the costs and expenses, to be assessed and paid as the court directs, shall be raised by a sale or mortgage of a sufficient part of such land or out of the rents or profits thereof\.
