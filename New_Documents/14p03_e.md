Preamble

Pope John Paul II, who was born in Poland on May 18, 1920, reigned as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church from October 16, 1978 until his death on April 2, 2005\.  His reign was marked by his steadfast opposition to communism, and he is often credited as one of the forces that contributed to its collapse in Eastern Europe in 1990\.  The year 2014 marks the 25th anniversary of the fall of communism in Central and Eastern European countries\.

The legacy of Pope John Paul II reflects his lifelong commitment to international understanding, peace and the defence of equality and human rights\.  His legacy has an all\-embracing meaning that is particularly relevant to Canada’s multi\-faith and multicultural traditions and experience\.  

As one of the great spiritual leaders of contemporary times, Pope John Paul II visited Ontario twice during his pontificate of more than 25 years\.  On his visits, he was enthusiastically greeted by our province’s diverse religious and cultural communities\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Pope John Paul II Day
