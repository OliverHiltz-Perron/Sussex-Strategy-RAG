Preamble

Posttraumatic stress disorder \(PTSD\) is an anxiety disorder that can occur after a person has experienced or witnessed a traumatic event\. It causes intense fear, helplessness or extreme anxiety\.

PTSD can affect anyone, regardless of socio\-economic status, gender, age, nationality or vocation\. However, first responders, military personnel, emergency personnel, correctional services workers, and victims and their families are particularly at risk\.

PTSD has become a global health issue and its prevalence is gaining awareness\. In Ontario, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997 specifies that for first responders and other designated workers, their PTSD is presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of their employment\.

In 2010, the United States Congress designated June 27 in each year as National PTSD Awareness Day\. Making a similar designation in Ontario can raise awareness for this disorder and help thousands of people in the province and beyond move past stigma, isolation and helplessness and towards resources, understanding and, ultimately, the road to recovery\.

PTSD Awareness Day

__1 __June 27 in each year is proclaimed as PTSD Awareness Day\.

2 Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

3__ __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
