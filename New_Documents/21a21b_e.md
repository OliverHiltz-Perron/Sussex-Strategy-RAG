Preamble

<a id="BK0"></a>Human trafficking is a human rights violation and a complex problem in Ontario that takes many forms\.

Ontario recognizes that human trafficking impacts individuals and communities across the province, and that certain populations may be disproportionately impacted by human trafficking, such as women and girls and racialized groups including Indigenous and Black communities\.

A survivor\-centred, comprehensive and collaborative approach is required to protect those most vulnerable, to support survivors and to end human trafficking in Ontario\.

Human rights\-based

Trauma\-informed

	5\.	Supports provided across service systems over the course of survivors’ lives should be informed by the complexity and pervasiveness of trauma and the risk of re\-traumatization\.

Informed by evidence

	6\.	Decisions should be guided by diverse sources of evidence, including survivors’ experiences, promising practices and traditional Indigenous knowledge\.

Sustainability and agility

	7\.	A sustainable and agile approach is necessary to adapt to the changing nature of human trafficking and to achieve the strategy’s aims\.
