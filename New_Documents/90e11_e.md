Remuneration

\(1\.2\)  The following rules apply in determining for the purposes of this Act the amount of remuneration or total Ontario remuneration paid by an employer:

	1\.	An amount paid by the employer to a trustee or custodian, as the case may be, for the benefit of an employee under an employees profit sharing plan, employee benefit plan, employee trust or salary deferral arrangement is deemed to be remuneration paid by the employer to or on behalf of the employee if the amount, upon payment or allocation to the employee, is by reason of section 5, 6 or 7 of the Income Tax Act \(Canada\) required to be included in the income of a person under that Act\.

Reporting for work at a permanent establishment

\(3\.1\)  For the purposes of this Act, an employee is considered to report for work at a permanent establishment of an employer,

	\(a\)	if the employee comes to the permanent establishment in person to work; or

	\(b\)	if, although the employee does not come to the permanent establishment in person to work, he or she may reasonably be regarded as attached to the permanent establishment\.  2002, c\. 22, s\. 65; 2004, c\. 16, Sched\. D, Table\.

\(4\), \(5\)  Repealed:  2009, c\. 18, Sched\. 11, s\. 1 \(3\)\.

	\(c\)	if an employer is a partnership or trust, it shall be deemed to be a corporation having only one class of issued shares which have full voting rights under all circumstances, and each member of the partnership or beneficiary of the trust, as the case may be, shall be deemed to own at a particular time the greatest proportion of the number of issued shares of the capital stock of the corporation that,

	\(i\)	the member’s or beneficiary’s share of the income or loss of the partnership or trust for the fiscal period of the partnership or trust that includes that time,

is of,

	\(ii\)	the income or loss of the partnership or trust for that period,

Remuneration of former employees

\(6\)  Remuneration received or deemed to be received after May 7, 1996 by an individual who is no longer employed by an employer shall be included in the total Ontario remuneration of the employer if the remuneration is in respect of the previous employment with the employer or is received or deemed to be received by virtue of the individual’s having been employed by the employer\.  1996, c\. 24, s\. 1 \(4\)\.

Deemed remuneration

\(7\)  If all of the following circumstances exist, an amount paid to an employee of an employer by a third person after December 31, 1998 shall be deemed to be remuneration paid by the employer to the employee:

	1\.	The amount is paid to the employee for providing a service in Ontario to a person other than the employer\.

	2\.	The service is substantially similar to employment functions that can reasonably be expected to be performed by an employee of the employer in the normal course of employment\.

	3\.	At the time the employee provides the service, he or she is an employee of the employer\.

	6\.	The amount is not otherwise included in the employer’s total Ontario remuneration paid for the year\.  1998, c\. 34, s\. 59\.

	1\.	If the taxation year is less than 51 weeks and is the only taxation year ending in a calendar year, the eligible expenditures, total expenses and total revenue for the taxation year are the amounts otherwise determined, multiplied by the ratio of 365 to the number of days in the taxation year\.

	2\.	If the taxation year is not the only taxation year of the employer ending in the same calendar year, the amount of the employer’s eligible expenditures, total expenses and total revenue for the taxation year is the total of those amounts for all taxation years ending in that calendar year, as otherwise determined, multiplied by the ratio of 365 to the total number of days in those taxation years\.

	3\.	If the taxation year of a corporation that is associated with the employer is less than 51 weeks and is the only taxation year of the associated corporation ending in the employer’s taxation year, the corporation’s eligible expenditures, total expenses and total revenue for that taxation year are the amounts otherwise determined, multiplied by the ratio of 365 to the number of days in the taxation year\.

	4\.	If a fiscal period of a partnership of which the employer or the associated corporation is a member is less than 51 weeks and is the only fiscal period of the partnership ending in the taxation year of the employer or the associated corporation, as the case may be, the eligible expenditures, total expenses and total revenue of the partnership for that fiscal period are the amounts otherwise determined, multiplied by the ratio of 365 to the number of days in the fiscal period\.

	5\.	If a corporation who is associated with the employer has two or more taxation years ending in the employer’s taxation year, the eligible expenditures, total expenses and total revenue of the associated corporation for the taxation year ending in the employer’s taxation year are the total of those amounts for all of its taxation years ending in the employer’s taxation year, as otherwise determined, multiplied by the ratio of 365 to the total number of days in all of those taxation years\.

	6\.	If a partnership of which the employer or the associated corporation is a member has two or more fiscal periods ending in the taxation year of the employer or the associated corporation, as the case may be, the eligible expenditures, total expenses and total revenue for the fiscal period of the partnership ending in the taxation year of the employer or the associated corporation, as the case may be, are those amounts for all of its fiscal periods ending in the taxation year, as otherwise determined, multiplied by the ratio of 365 to the total number of days in all of the fiscal periods\.  2000, c\. 42, s\. 45; 2004, c\. 16, Sched\.

Waiver by Minister

\(4\)  In the certificate issued under subsection \(2\), or in any replacement thereof issued after a request by the out\-of\-province employer, the Minister may waive the requirement that the out\-of\-province employer provide security if the Minister is satisfied at the time the certificate or replacement certificate is issued that,
