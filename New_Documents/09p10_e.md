Preamble

Recognizing that the reduction of poverty supports the social, economic and cultural development of Ontario, the Government of Ontario published on December 4, 2008 Breaking the Cycle — Ontario’s Poverty Reduction Strategy, a comprehensive long\-term strategy to reduce poverty\.  The Government’s poverty reduction strategy is guided by the vision of a province where every person has the opportunity to achieve his or her full potential, and contribute to and participate in a prosperous and healthy Ontario and builds on the foundations of Ontario’s education system and the Ontario Child Benefit Program\.

A principal goal of the Government’s strategy published on December 4, 2008 is to achieve a 25 per cent reduction in the number of Ontario children living in poverty within five years\.

The initial focus of the Government’s strategy is on breaking the cycle of intergenerational poverty by improving opportunities for children, particularly through the education system\.

The implementation and success of the strategy will require the sustained commitment of all levels of government, all sectors of Ontario society and a growing economy\.

The Government of Ontario is committed,

	\(a\)	to regular consultations with respect to the strategy;

	\(b\)	to measuring the success of the strategy by setting a target at least every five years and assessing indicators of poverty reduction; and

	\(c\)	to reporting annually on the success of the strategy\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Purpose

__1 __The purpose of this Act is to establish mechanisms to support a sustained long\-term reduction of poverty in Ontario\.  2009, c\. 10, s\. 1\.

Definition

__1\.1  __In this Act,

“Minister” means the minister to whom the administration of this Act is assigned under the Executive Council Act\. 2015, c\. 20, Sched\. 36, s\. 1\.

[2015, c\. 20, Sched\. 36, s\. 1](http://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/S15020" \l "sched36s1) \- 04/06/2015

Poverty reduction strategy

__2 __\(1\)  The Government of Ontario shall maintain the poverty reduction strategy set out in Breaking the Cycle — Ontario’s Poverty Reduction Strategy published on December 4, 2008, or another poverty reduction strategy,

	\(a\)	that reflects Ontario’s aspiration to be a leading jurisdiction in reducing poverty; and

	\(b\)	that is guided by the vision of a province where every person has the opportunity to achieve his or her full potential and contribute to and participate in a prosperous and healthy Ontario\.  2009, c\. 10, s\. 2 \(1\)\.

Principles

\(2\)  Every new or modified poverty reduction strategy is to be based on the following principles:

Importance of all Ontarians

	1\.	That there is untapped potential in Ontario’s population that needs to be drawn upon by building and establishing supports for, and eliminating barriers to, full participation by all people in Ontario’s economy and society and, in particular, persons who face discrimination on the grounds of their race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, family status or disability\.

Importance of communities

	2\.	That strong, healthy communities are an integral part of the poverty reduction strategy; their potential must be brought to bear on the reduction of poverty\.

Recognition of diversity

	3\.	That not all groups of people share the same level of risk of poverty\.  The poverty reduction strategy must recognize the heightened risk among groups such as immigrants, women, single mothers, people with disabilities, aboriginal peoples and racialized groups\.

Importance of support and involvement of families

	4\.	That families be supported so that they can play a meaningful role in the reduction of poverty and in promoting opportunity\.  

Respect

	5\.	That all people in Ontario, including those living in poverty, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity\. 

Involvement

	6\.	That Ontarians, especially people living in poverty, are to be involved in the design and implementation of the strategy\.

Commitment and co\-operation

	7\.	That a sustained commitment to work together to develop strong and healthy children, youth, adults, families and communities is required to effectively reduce poverty\.

Importance of the third sector

	8\.	That the third sector, including non\-profit, charitable and voluntary organizations, are integral to a poverty reduction strategy by delivering the programs and services that matter to people, by strengthening communities and by making a positive contribution to the economy\.
