Preamble

Métis Nation of Ontario Secretariat is a corporation without share capital incorporated under the Corporations Act\. It is the corporate and administrative arm of the Métis Nation of Ontario, which was created to represent and advocate on behalf of its registered citizens, and the Métis communities comprised of those citizens, with respect to their collective rights, interests and aspirations, as well as to provide social, economic and cultural supports to Métis individuals, families and communities through a province\-wide service delivery system\.

The Métis Nation of Ontario maintains a centralized registry of its citizens\. The members of Métis Nation of Ontario Secretariat are citizens of the Métis Nation of Ontario, with defined rights and responsibilities, as set out in the Secretariat’s constituting documents and by\-laws\.

The citizens of the Métis Nation of Ontario identify as descendants of the Métis people that emerged in west central North America with their own language \(Michif\), culture, traditions and way of life\. These Métis people collectively refer to themselves as the Métis Nation, which includes Métis communities within Ontario\.

Through Métis Nation of Ontario Secretariat, the Métis Nation of Ontario has established various democratically elected governance structures at the local, regional and provincial levels to represent its citizens\. The Government of Ontario recognizes that the Secretariat’s status as a governance structure that represents its citizens at the local, regional and provincial levels creates operational realities that are distinct from other Ontario not\-for\-profit corporations\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:
