<a id="BK23"></a><a id="BK3"></a><a id="BK2"></a>Preamble

<a id="BK113"></a>The Government of Ontario affirms that it is committed to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples\.

The Government of Ontario acknowledges that the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to establish and control their educational systems and institutions providing education in their own languages, in a manner appropriate to their cultural methods of teaching and learning\.

In Ontario, Indigenous Institutes are Indigenous governed and operated community\-based education institutions that are mandated by and accountable to Indigenous communities\.

Indigenous Institutes primarily provide accessible post\-secondary education and training, and pathways to further learning primarily to Indigenous students in a culturally safe environment\.

Indigenous Institutes provide education framed by Indigenous knowledge and languages, worldviews and Indigenous ways of knowing and living, and represent one pathway among others for Indigenous communities and students to achieve their educational visions and goals\.

Recognizing that Indigenous Institutes play a unique role in the post\-secondary education system of Ontario, the Government of Ontario and Indigenous Institutes have come together, in the spirit of reconciliation, mutual respect and mutual accountability, to enhance educational opportunities for Indigenous students, and to promote the revitalization of Indigenous knowledge, cultures and languages\.
