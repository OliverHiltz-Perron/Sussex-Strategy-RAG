<a id="BK3"></a>Infrastructure Planning Principles

Principles

<a id="BK4"></a>__3 __The Government, and every broader public sector entity, shall consider the following principles when making decisions respecting infrastructure:

	1\.	Infrastructure planning and investment should take a long\-term view, and decision\-makers should take into account the needs of Ontarians by being mindful of, among other things, demographic and economic trends in Ontario\.

	2\.	Infrastructure planning and investment should take into account any applicable budgets or fiscal plans, such as fiscal plans released under the Fiscal Sustainability, Transparency and Accountability Act, 2019 and budgets adopted under Part VII of the Municipal Act, 2001 or Part VII of the City of Toronto Act, 2006\.

	3\.	Infrastructure priorities should be clearly identified in order to better inform investment decisions respecting infrastructure\.

	4\.	Infrastructure planning and investment should ensure the continued provision of core public services, such as health care and education\.

	5\.	Infrastructure planning and investment should promote economic competitiveness, productivity, job creation and training opportunities\.

	6\.	Infrastructure planning and investment should ensure that the health and safety of workers involved in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure assets is protected\.

	7\.	Infrastructure planning and investment should foster innovation by creating opportunities to make use of innovative technologies, services and practices, particularly where doing so would utilize technology, techniques and practices developed in Ontario\.

	8\.	Infrastructure planning and investment should be evidence based and transparent, and, subject to any restrictions or prohibitions under an Act or otherwise by law on the collection, use or disclosure of information,

	i\.	investment decisions respecting infrastructure should be made on the basis of information that is either publicly available or is made available to the public, and

	ii\.	information with implications for infrastructure planning should be shared between the Government and broader public sector entities, and should factor into investment decisions respecting infrastructure\.

	9\.	Where provincial or municipal plans or strategies have been established in Ontario, under an Act or otherwise, but do not bind or apply to the Government or the broader public sector entity, as the case may be, the Government or broader public sector entity should nevertheless be mindful of those plans and strategies and make investment decisions respecting infrastructure that support them, to the extent that they are relevant\. Examples of plans and strategies to which this paragraph may apply include,

	i\.	policy statements issued under section 3 of the Planning Act, and provincial plans as defined by that Act,

	ii\.	municipal water sustainability plans submitted under the Water Opportunities Act, 2010,

	iii\.	the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan established under the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008, and

	iv\.	transportation plans adopted under the Metro­linx Act, 2006\. 

	10\.	Infrastructure planning and investment should promote accessibility for persons with disabilities\.

	11\.	Infrastructure planning and investment should minimize the impact of infrastructure on the environment and respect and help maintain ecological and biological diversity, and infrastructure should be designed to be resilient to the effects of climate change\.

	12\.	Infrastructure planning and investment should endeavour to make use of acceptable recycled aggregates\.

	13\.	Infrastructure planning and investment should promote community benefits, being the supplementary social and economic benefits arising from an infrastructure project that are intended to improve the well\-being of a community affected by the project, such as local job creation and training opportunities \(including for apprentices, within the meaning of section 9\), improvement of public space within the community, and any specific benefits identified by the community\.

	14\.	Any other principles that may be prescribed for the Government or the broader public sector entity, as the case may be\. 2015, c\. 15, s\. 3; 2019, c\. 7, Sched\. 30, s\. 21\.
