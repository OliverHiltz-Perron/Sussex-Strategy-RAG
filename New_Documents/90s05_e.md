Exception

\(3\)  The Commission does not have to make reference to written material that, in the opinion of the Commission, should be held in confidence because it discloses intimate financial, personal or other information and the desirability of avoiding disclosure of the substance of it or its existence in the interests of any person or company affected outweighs the desirability of making it or knowledge of its existence available to the public\.  1994, c\. 33, s\. 8\.

	\(c\)	what is proposed is only an amendment that does not materially change an existing rule; or

	\(d\)	the Commission,

	\(i\)	believes that there is an urgent need for the proposed rule and that, without it, there is a substantial risk of material harm to investors or to the integrity of the capital markets, and

	\(ii\)	has the approval of the Minister to make the rule without publication of notice\.

Making rule

\(10\)  In cases where a notice and comment process is required, the Commission may make the rule only at the end of the notice and comment process and after considering all representations made as a result of that process\.  1994, c\. 33, s\. 8\.

Inspection of material

\(11\)  Section 140 applies to all written representations made under this section as if they were material required to be filed\.  1994, c\. 33, s\. 8\.
