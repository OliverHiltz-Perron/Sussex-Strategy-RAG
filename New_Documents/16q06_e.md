Preamble

<a id="BK0"></a>The people of Ontario and their Government:

Believe in patient\-centred health care;

Remain committed to improving the quality of health care provided by health facilities and maintaining the safety of patients;

Believe that quality health care and patient safety is best achieved in a manner that supports openness and transparency to patients and their authorized representatives regarding patient health care;

Recognize that health care providers and other staff in health facilities sometimes need to hold confidential discussions to identify and analyze errors affecting patients, systemic problems and opportunities for quality improvement in patient health care;

Believe that protections are needed to encourage and enable health care providers and other staff of health facilities to share all available information, provide honest assessment and opinions and participate in discussions to improve patient health care without fear of retaliation;

Believe that sharing information about critical incidents and quality improvement helps to improve the quality of health care for patients;

Are committed to ensuring that measures to facilitate the sharing of information for quality improvement purposes do not interfere with the right of patients and their authorized representatives to access information about their health care or with the obligations of health facilities to disclose such information to patients and their authorized representatives; and 

Affirm that the inclusion of patients and their authorized representatives in the process of reviewing a critical incident helps to improve patient care, and therefore quality of care information protection must be implemented in a manner that supports such inclusion\.
