<a id="BK3"></a>Identification of Invasive Species and Carriers

Application of Act

<a id="BK4"></a>__3 __\(1\)  Unless otherwise indicated in a provision of this Act or the regulations, this Act applies only with respect to,

	\(a\)	invasive species that are prescribed by regulation under section 4 or designated by the Minister under section 5; and

	\(b\)	carriers that are prescribed by regulation under section 6\.

Similar species

\(2\)  For the purposes of the application and enforcement of this Act, a member of a species that is not easily distinguished from a member of an invasive species to which this Act applies shall be deemed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be a member of the invasive species\.

Regulations re: invasive species 

<a id="BK5"></a>__4 __\(1\)  The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations prescribing invasive species as invasive species to which this Act applies\.

Classes of invasive species

\(2\)  A regulation under subsection \(1\) shall classify each prescribed invasive species into one of the following classes:

	1\.	A prohibited invasive species, being an invasive species to which the prohibitions set out in section 7 and the measures set out in sections 23 and 27 apply\.

	2\.	A restricted invasive species, being an invasive species to which the prohibitions set out in subsection 8 \(1\) apply and to which conditions, restrictions or prohibitions may be added by regulation under subsection 8 \(2\) or \(3\) and measures set out in sections 23 and 27 may be made to apply by regulation\.

Same

\(3\)  The classification of an invasive species under subsection \(2\) shall be based on the extent to which the species is present in the natural environment in Ontario at the time the regulation is made and on other considerations such as the following:

	1\.	The species’ biological characteristics\.

	2\.	The harm the species has had on the natural environment, if any, or is likely to have in the future\.

	3\.	The dispersal ability of the species\.

	4\.	The social or economic impacts of the species\.

Temporary designation of invasive species

	\(a\)	the invasive species poses a serious and imminent threat to the natural environment that requires the immediate application of the provisions of this Act and of such other safeguards as may be specified in the order; and

	\(b\)	delays required for making a regulation under section 4 prescribing the invasive species as an invasive species to which this Act applies would unduly increase the threat of harm that the invasive species poses to the natural environment in Ontario or a part of Ontario\.

Effect of order

\(2\)  If an order is made under subsection \(1\), the following sections of this Act shall apply to the designated invasive species as if it were a prohibited invasive species:

	1\.	Section 7 \(Prohibited invasive species, prohibitions\)\.

	\(c\)	authorize a person or class of persons specified in the order to carry out any of the activities or acts prohibited under this Act or in the order, subject to such conditions as may be specified in the order\.

Content of order

\(4\)  An order designating an invasive species shall,

	1\.	The day a regulation is made under section 4 prescribing the invasive species\.

	2\.	The day specified in the order designating the invasive species\.

	3\.	The second anniversary of the day the order designating the invasive species is made\.

Prohibitions

\(6\)  No person shall engage in an activity that is prohibited by an order designating an invasive species except in accordance with the order\.

Publication of order

\(7\)  The Minister shall cause the order to be published,

	\(b\)	in any other manner the Minister considers appropriate\. 

Amendments

\(8\)  The Minister may amend an order designating an invasive species to change,

	\(a\)	the duration of the order;

Same

\(9\)  An amendment to an order under subsection \(1\) shall not extend the duration of the order beyond the two\-year period referred to in paragraph 3 of subsection \(5\)\.

Revocation

\(10\)  The Minister may revoke an order made designating an invasive species if he or she is of the opinion the order is no longer necessary to reduce or eliminate the threat to the natural environment posed by the invasive species\.

Publication

\(11\)  The Minister shall publish an amendment or revocation of an order under subsection \(1\) in accordance with subsection \(7\)\.

Not a regulation

\(12\)  An order made under this section is not a regulation for the purposes of Part III \(Regulations\) of the Legislation Act, 2006\.
