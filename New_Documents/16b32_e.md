Preamble

Ontario is home to a large and vibrant Bangladeshi community\. Bangladeshi Canadians from across the province have made significant contributions to Ontario’s scientific, athletic, cultural and political development, and they continue to help foster growth, prosperity, and innovation throughout Ontario\.

The month of March is an important one for the Bangladeshi community\. Every year on March 26th, Bangladeshis around the world celebrate Independence Day in commemoration of their nation gaining independence in 1971\. This day is often marked with music, parades, fairs, and various other public and private gatherings held to celebrate the history and traditions of Bangladesh\.

By proclaiming the month of March as Bangladeshi Heritage Month in Ontario, the province honours the many significant contributions Bangladeshi Canadians have made throughout the province, and highlights their important role in strengthening the multi\-cultural fabric that keeps Ontario’s communities strong\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Bangladeshi Heritage Month
