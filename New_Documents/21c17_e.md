Preamble

Convenience stores provide the daily necessities Ontarians need\. Their dedicated employees work around the clock to ensure their stores are open when customers do not have access to other retail options\. The convenience and essential nature of this industry was seen first\-hand during the COVID\-19 pandemic\. Ontario’s convenience stores ensured that their shelves were well stocked, and stores were clean and safe to provide the necessities for their customers\. Customers rely on the convenience industry because of their convenient locations and hours of service\. Convenience stores, particularly in rural and remote communities, are often the only source of fresh food and other daily necessities\.

During this time, the convenience store sector has become increasingly important to those front\-line workers in health care and other essential services who have been working around the clock and who may not have convenient access to other retail options before or after their shifts\.

By proclaiming the seven\-day period in each year ending the Saturday immediately before Labour Day as Convenience Store Week, the Province of Ontario recognizes the important role of convenience stores\.

Convenience Store Week is an opportunity to celebrate the hard\-working front\-line employees in the convenience store industry and mark the significant contributions convenience stores have on Ontario’s economy\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Convenience Store Week

__1 __The seven\-day period in each year that ends on the Saturday immediately before Labour Day is proclaimed as Convenience Store Week\.

2 Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

3__ __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
