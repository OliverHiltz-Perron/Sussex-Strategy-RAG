Preamble

Tibetan Canadians are proud to be part of the diverse communities of Ontario and Canada\. Tibetans were some of the earliest government\-sponsored non\-European refugees to settle in Canada\.

Thanks to the support of the Canadian people and the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, today the Tibetan population in Canada has grown and flourished to become a remarkable addition to Canada’s diverse cultural mosaic\. The Tibetan community has contributed to the growth of Canada in economic, social and political fields and, most importantly, has brought the rich and ancient cultural practices of non\-violence and compassion to Canada\.

July is a significant month for the Tibetan community\. On July 6, Tibetans around the world and Tibetan\-Canadians across Ontario celebrate the birthday of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, an honorary Canadian citizen\. This day symbolizes the unity of Tibetan\-Canadians and their resilience as a people\.

By proclaiming the month of July as Tibetan Heritage Month, the province of Ontario recognizes the contributions of Tibetans in all aspects of Ontario society\. Tibetan Heritage Month is also an opportunity to educate future generations about the significant roles that Tibetan\-Canadians have played and continue to play across Ontario\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Tibetan Heritage Month

__1 __The month of July in each year is proclaimed as Tibetan Heritage Month\.

2 Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

3__ __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
