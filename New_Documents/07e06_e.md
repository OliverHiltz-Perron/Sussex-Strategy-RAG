Preamble

<a id="BK0"></a>Biological diversity is among the great treasures of our planet\.  It has ecological, social, economic, cultural and intrinsic value\.  Biological diversity makes many essential contributions to human life, including foods, clothing and medicines, and is an important part of sustainable social and economic development\.

Unfortunately, throughout the world, species of animals, plants and other organisms are being lost forever at an alarming rate\.  The loss of these species is most often due to human activities, especially activities that damage the habitats of these species\.  Global action is required\.

The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity takes note of the precautionary principle, which, as described in the Convention, states that, where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat\.

In Ontario, our native species are a vital component of our precious natural heritage\.  The people of Ontario wish to do their part in protecting species that are at risk, with appropriate regard to__ __social, economic and cultural considerations\.  The present generation of Ontarians should protect species at risk for future generations\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

<a id="BK1"></a>Introduction

Purposes

<a id="BK2"></a>__1 __The purposes of this Act are:

	1\.	To identify species at risk based on the best available scientific information, including information obtained from community knowledge and aboriginal traditional knowledge\.

	2\.	To protect species that are at risk and their habitats, and to promote the recovery of species that are at risk\.

	3\.	To promote stewardship activities to assist in the protection and recovery of species that are at risk\.  2007, c\. 6, s\. 1\.

Temporary suspension of protections upon initial listing

<a id="BK11"></a>__8\.1  __\(1\)  Subject to subsections \(2\) and \(3\), the Minister may, by regulation, order that, as of the day a species is listed on the Species at Risk in Ontario List as an endangered or threatened species for the first time, the application to the species of all or some of the prohibitions in subsections 9 \(1\) and 10 \(1\) shall be temporarily suspended\. 2019, c\. 9, Sched\. 5, s\. 7\.

Timing

\(2\)  An order under subsection \(1\) shall be made by the Minister after he or she receives a report from COSSARO under section 6 classifying a species as endangered or threatened but before the amendment is made to the Species at Risk in Ontario List under section 7 to reflect the new classification of the species by COSSARO\. 2019, c\. 9, Sched\. 5, s\. 7\.

Criteria

\(3\)  The Minister may make an order under subsection \(1\) only if,

	\(a\)	before the report was submitted by COSSARO under section 6, the species was not listed as an endangered or threatened species on the Species at Risk in Ontario List;

	\(b\)	the Minister is of the opinion that,

	\(i\)	the application of the prohibitions would likely have significant social or economic implications for all or parts of Ontario and, as a result, additional time is required to determine the best approach to protecting the species and its habitat, and

	\(ii\)	the temporary suspension will not jeopardize the survival of the species in Ontario; and

	\(c\)	the Minister is of the opinion that the species meets at least one of the following criteria:

	\(i\)	the species is broadly distributed in the wild in Ontario,

	\(ii\)	the amount, quality and availability of the species’ habitat in Ontario is not currently limiting its survival or recovery in Ontario,

	\(iii\)	addressing the primary threats to the species is not currently possible or feasible and additional time is needed to assess the best approach to addressing those threats,

	\(iv\)	successfully reducing the primary threats to the species requires the cooperation of other jurisdictions and additional time is needed to address the inter\-jurisdictional complexities of addressing those threats, or

	\(v\)	any other criteria prescribed by the regulations made by the Lieutenant Governor in Council\. 2019, c\. 9, Sched\. 5, s\. 7\.

Order

\(4\)  An order under subsection \(1\) shall,
