Preamble

Approximately 1,000 Canadian workers are killed on the job each year, while hundreds of thousands more are injured or diseased\. It is estimated that over 90 per cent of workplace deaths are preventable\. Raised awareness is necessary\. But because risk remains an inherent part of many jobs, all workers, especially young workers, need to be aware of workplace dangers they could face\.

It is important to designate a day of mourning to remember workers who have been killed, injured or suffered disease as a result of work\-related incidents, and to honour their families\.

A day of mourning also serves to protect the living by strengthening our commitment to health and safety in all workplaces in Ontario, helping to prevent additional deaths, injuries and diseases\.

In 1988, the Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a resolution recognizing April 28 as a day of mourning for workers\. In 1991, the Parliament of Canada passed the Workers Mourning Day Act* *\(Canada\)\. Today, a workers day of mourning is recognized in more than 100 countries around the world\. However, not enough is being done within the “MUSH sector” \(municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals\) to recognize this day\. It is appropriate that the Province of Ontario build on the provincial resolution and on the federal Act by recognizing in provincial law a workers day of mourning and requiring the lowering of flags to half\-mast\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Workers Day of Mourning

__1 __April 28 in each year is proclaimed as Workers Day of Mourning\.

Flags at half\-mast

__2 __All Canadian and Ontario flags flown outside the following shall be flown at half\-mast on April 28 in each year:
