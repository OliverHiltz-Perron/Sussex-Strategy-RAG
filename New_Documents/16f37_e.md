\(3\)  The Authority does not have to make reference to written material that, in the opinion of the Authority, should be held in confidence because it discloses sensitive financial, personal or other information and the desirability of avoiding disclosure of the substance of it or its existence in the interests of any person affected outweighs the desirability of making it or knowledge of its existence available to the public\. 2017, c\. 34, Sched\. 16, s\. 11\.
