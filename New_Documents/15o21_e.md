Preamble

Ontario has a rich history and diverse heritage\. 

From the early Aboriginal peoples who first called this land home, to Anglophone and Francophone settlers like Henry Hudson and Samuel de Champlain, to the millions of immigrants who continue to arrive on our shores from around the world, Ontario is one of the most diverse places in the world\.

Ontario has been built through the hard work of generations of people, through their commitment to values such as mutual respect and acceptance and their enduring belief in and support for freedom, democracy and human rights\.

Ontarians from across our province have made and continue to make great contributions to the economic, social, political and cultural life of our province, our country and the world\. 

First recognized on May 21st, 1965, the Ontario flag symbolizes each of these contributions as well as our rich history, diverse heritage, distinct values and shared successes\. The Ontario flag represents all those who call Ontario home\. 

Paying tribute to the Ontario flag allows us to celebrate all Ontario citizens and their countless contributions while honouring our history, heritage, values and successes\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Ontario Flag Day
