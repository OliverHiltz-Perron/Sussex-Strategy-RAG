Preamble

On April 6, 2018, Canadians were heartbroken to hear the news of the Humboldt Broncos bus crash\. Sixteen of the 29 passengers lost their lives in the crash while the remaining 13 have been left with physical and emotional scars they will carry for life\. 

Logan Boulet, a defenceman for the Humboldt Broncos, succumbed to his injuries on April 7, 2018\. Prior to the accident, Logan shared with his family his decision to register as an organ donor\. Logan’s heroic choice was inspired by his coach and mentor, Ric Suggit, who passed away on June 27, 2017, saving six lives with his organ donation\.  

After his death, Logan’s parents, Toby and Bernadine Boulet, fulfilled Logan’s wishes and donated his organs\. His life\-giving donation helped another six individuals in need of organ and tissues transplants\. As news spread of Logan’s organ donation, it is estimated that almost 150,000 people registered to become organ donors in the weeks that followed his death\. This phenomenon became known across Canada as the “Logan Boulet Effect”\.

Green Shirt Day, recognized across Canada, was created by the Boulet family with the hopes of inspiring Canadians to consider organ and tissue donation and to discuss the issue with their family members\.  

April 7, 2022 will be the fourth anniversary of Logan Boulet’s passing\. By proclaiming April 7 as Green Shirt Day, the Province of Ontario recognizes the significance of organ and tissue donations and the lasting impact of the Logan Boulet Effect\. Green Shirt Day serves as an opportunity to spread awareness and educate Ontarians about organ and tissue donation and to honour the victims and survivors of the Humboldt Broncos bus crash, as well as their families\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Green Shirt Day

__1 __April 7 in each year is proclaimed as Green Shirt Day\.

__2__ Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

__3__ Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
