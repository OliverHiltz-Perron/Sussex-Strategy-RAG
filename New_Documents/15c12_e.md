Christmas Tree Day Act, 2015

S\.o\. 2015, chapter 12

__Consolidation Period:__  From June 2, 2015 to the [e\-Laws currency date](http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/navigation?file=currencyDates&lang=en)\.

No amendments\.

Preamble

Real Christmas trees have been enjoyed in Ontario since before Confederation\.

The Christmas tree industry employs thousands of workers in the farming, transportation and retail sectors\. Each year, more than one million fresh, farm\-grown Christmas trees are purchased in Ontario, and the same number of seedlings are planted for future harvests\.

In light of the assertion by the Christmas Tree Farmers of Ontario and the Canadian Christmas Tree Growers Association that Christmas tree farms and recycled Christmas trees provide environmental benefits, as well as to celebrate the joy Christmas trees bring to families across Ontario, it is appropriate that the Christmas tree industry receives recognition\. 

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Christmas Tree Day

<a id="s1"></a>	[1\.](http://www.ontario.ca/fr/lois/loi/15c12" \l "s1)__  __The first Saturday in December in each year is proclaimed as Christmas Tree Day\.

<a id="s2"></a>	[2\.](http://www.ontario.ca/fr/lois/loi/15c12" \l "s2)  Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

<a id="s3"></a>	[3\.](http://www.ontario.ca/fr/lois/loi/15c12" \l "s3)  Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
