Preamble

Myasthenia Gravis is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which antibodies destroy the communication between nerves and muscle, resulting in weakness of the skeletal muscles\. The disorder affects the voluntary muscles of the body, especially those that control the eyes, mouth, throat and limbs\. A Myasthenia Gravis crisis can involve difficulty in swallowing or breathing\. The following are the most common symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis:

	1\.	Visual problems, including drooping eyelids \(ptosis\) and double vision \(diplopia\)\.

	2\.	Muscle weakness and fatigue that may vary rapidly in intensity over days or even hours and worsen as muscles are used \(early fatigue\)\.

	3\.	Facial muscle involvement causing a mask\-like appearance; a smile may appear more like a snarl\.

	4\.	Trouble swallowing or pronouncing words\.

	5\.	Weakness of the neck or limbs\.

Myasthenia Gravis is not inherited and it is not contagious; it is caused when antibodies attack receptors on muscle thereby blocking a chemical needed to stimulate muscle contraction\.

It is estimated that there are 26\.3 cases of Myasthenia Gravis per 100,000 people in Ontario, meaning this disorder impacts more than 3,800 Ontario residents\.

The disorder can strike anyone at any age, but is more frequently seen in young women between the age 20 and 30 and in men aged 50 and older\. The cause of Myasthenia Gravis is unknown and there is no cure, but early detection and prompt medical management can help people live longer, more functional lives\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Myasthenia Gravis Month

__1 __The month of June in each year is proclaimed as Myasthenia Gravis Month\.

2 Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

3__ __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
