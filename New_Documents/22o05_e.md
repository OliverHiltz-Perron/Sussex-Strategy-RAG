Preamble

Canada has a dynamic cadet program with numerous cadet corps and squadrons across Ontario\. The Air Cadet League, Ontario Provincial Committee; the Army Cadet League of Canada \(Ontario\); and the Navy League of Canada, in partnership with the Canadian Armed Forces, provide programs for air, army and sea cadets 12 to 18 years of age\. The Navy League of Canada also sponsors the Navy League Cadets, a separate program for youth 9 to 12\.

All of the cadet programs assist young people to develop skills that serve them well in their transition to adulthood\. Cadet programs focus on physical fitness, leadership, citizenship and teamwork skills, providing experiences not found anywhere else\.

Cadets are active members of their communities and make valuable contributions to society on a daily basis\. Proclaiming Ontario Cadets Week will honour the outstanding young Canadians whose unique personal and collective development through cadet programs will help them be successful in Canadian society, as well as recognizing those who support the programs directly and indirectly\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Ontario Cadets Week

__1 __The week starting on the first Saturday in October in each year is proclaimed as Ontario Cadets Week\.

2 Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

3__ __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
