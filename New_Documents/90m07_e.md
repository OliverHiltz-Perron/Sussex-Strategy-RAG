	\(iii\)	if the person does not receive continuing treatment or care and continuing supervision while living in the community, he or she is likely, because of mental disorder, to cause serious bodily harm to himself or herself or to another person or to suffer substantial mental or physical deterioration of the person or serious physical impairment of the person,

	\(b\)	the facts on which the physician formed the opinion referred to in clause \(4\) \(c\);

	\(c\)	a description of the community treatment plan referred to in clause \(4\) \(b\); and

	\(d\)	an undertaking by the person to comply with his or her obligations as set out in subsection \(9\) or an undertaking by the person’s substitute decision\-maker to use his or her best efforts to ensure that the person complies with those obligations\.  2000, c\. 9, s\. 15\.
