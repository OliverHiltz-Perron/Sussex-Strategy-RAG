Preamble

Fresh, nutritious, locally\-grown food is necessary for daily life and for maintaining proper health and wellness\. Locally\-grown food is also an essential component of Ontario’s agriculture sector\. Farmers and other agriculture sector workers are responsible for the production and supply of food that will be sold to grocery stores, farmers markets and local suppliers in Ontario\.

As the most diverse country in North America, Canada has a rich culinary culture that is worthy of celebration\. Food Day Ontario \(Food Day Canada in Ontario\) honours our farmers, chefs, fishermen, researchers and home cooks, and is a great opportunity for Ontarians to share their menu and stories and to celebrate food\. It is also a great opportunity to showcase Ontario’s agriculture products to the rest of Canada and the world\.

The agri\-food industry employs over 2\.3 million Canadians and accounts for one in eight jobs in the Canadian economy\. The industry contributes over $47\.7 billion GDP annually to Ontario’s economy alone\. Food Day Ontario \(Food Day Canada in Ontario\) will encourage restaurants and consumers to purchase locally\-produced ingredients and to support our local suppliers\. Food Day Ontario \(Food Day Canada in Ontario\) will unite our communities, create jobs, and boost our economy\.

Ontario farmers and processors produce safe and high quality food\. We should continue to promote quality nutritious food\. This will have an added benefit to the rural communities in Ontario, as more Ontarians will choose to buy local\.

Culinary sovereignty, being able to feed Canadians with food from Canada, is an essential component of Food Day Ontario \(Food Day Canada in Ontario\)\. The day will promote culinary sovereignty by emphasizing local food, local producers and local businesses\. This will facilitate innovation and help make Ontario a culinary destination in Canada\.

An annual Food Day Ontario \(Food Day Canada in Ontario\) will recognize the hard work and dedication Ontario’s agriculture sector workers put in to providing nutritious and healthy food for so many communities\. This added recognition will encourage Ontarians, from chefs to home cooks, to buy local\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Food Day Ontario \(Food Day Canada in Ontario\)

__1 __The Saturday immediately before Civic Holiday in each year is proclaimed as Food Day Ontario \(Food Day Canada in Ontario\)\.

__2 __Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

__3__ Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
