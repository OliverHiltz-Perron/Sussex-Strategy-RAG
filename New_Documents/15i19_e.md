Preamble

It is important to provide an opportunity to raise awareness in daily life of the many benefits that simple and respectful connections between generations bring to education, health and community safety\. Stereotypes of both young and older people are broken down when Ontarians learn about each other\. Isolation is diminished and empathy grows in both directions\. Proclaiming Intergenerational Day Canada in Ontario makes a powerful statement about the value of making intergenerational connections\. 

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Intergenerational Day
