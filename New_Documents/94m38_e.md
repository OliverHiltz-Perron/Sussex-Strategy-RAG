Preamble

<a id="BK0"></a>It is desirable to provide greater certainty in the reconciliation of the private interests and public duties of members of the Legislative Assembly, recognizing the following principles:

	1\.	The Assembly as a whole can represent the people of Ontario most effectively if its members have experience and knowledge in relation to many aspects of life in Ontario and if they can continue to be active in their own communities, whether in business, in the practice of a profession or otherwise\.

	2\.	Members’ duty to represent their constituents includes broadly representing their constituents’ interests in the Assembly and to the Government of Ontario\.

	3\.	Members are expected to perform their duties of office and arrange their private affairs in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity of each member, maintains the Assembly’s dignity and justifies the respect in which society holds the Assembly and its members\.

	4\.	Members are expected to act with integrity and impartiality that will bear the closest scrutiny\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:
