Preamble

Ontario is home to more than 28,000 Albanian Canadians\. Since the early 20th century, the Albanian\-Canadian community has made and continues to make significant contributions to the growth and prosperity of the Province of Ontario\.

November is a significant month for the Albanian community\. Each year, during the month of November, people of Albanian origin celebrate the Albanian Declaration of Independence, which declared Albania an independent sovereign nation on November 28th, 1912\. 

In November, Albania also commemorates Liberation Day, which is the day that Albania was liberated from Nazi Germany forces after the Albanian resistance on November 29th, 1944\.

By proclaiming the month of November as Albanian Heritage Month, the Province of Ontario recognizes the meaningful contributions immigrants have made in building Ontario’s communities and the social, economic, political and cultural achievements of Albanian\-Canadians throughout the province\. Albanian Heritage Month is an opportunity to remember, celebrate and educate future generations about Ontario’s rich history\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Albanian Heritage Month
