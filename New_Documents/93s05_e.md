Preamble

<a id="BK0"></a>In order to achieve significant savings in public sector expenditures in a fair and equitable manner, the Government is committed to facilitating negotiations between representatives of public sector employers and their employees for the purpose of maintaining effective and efficient public services\.

To this end, the Government invited public sector employer and employee representatives and representatives of independent health practitioners to negotiate a Social Contract with the Government\. During the negotiations, which took place in April, May and June of 1993, the Government tabled a framework agreement that included provisions for:

— savings through unpaid leaves of absence while protecting public services and accommodating the preference of individual employees\.

— job security including redeployment and training and adjustment for employees\.

— the encouragement of efficiency and productivity savings in the public sector\.

— access to a fund to supplement unemployment insurance benefits or to permit the extension of notice periods or to allow for retraining\.

— protection for those earning less than $30,000 a year\.

It is desirable that legislation be enacted that carries out the general intent of the framework Social Contract by encouraging negotiated settlements while recognizing that a resolution is essential so that the necessary savings in public expenditures may be realized in a fair and equitable manner\.

Purposes

<a id="BK1"></a>__1 __The purposes of this Act are as follows:

	1\.	To encourage employers, bargaining agents and employees to achieve savings through agreements at the sectoral and local levels primarily through adjustments in compensation arrangements\.

	2\.	To maximize the preservation of public sector jobs and services through improvements in productivity, including the elimination of waste and inefficiency\.

	3\.	To provide for expenditure reduction for a three\-year period and to provide criteria and mechanisms for achieving the reductions\.

	4\.	To provide for a job security fund\. 1993, c\. 5, s\. 1\.
