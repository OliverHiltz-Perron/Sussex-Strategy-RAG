By\-law under the old Act

<a id="BK420"></a>__257\.103__¬†¬†\(1\)¬†¬†This section applies with respect to an education development charge by\-law under the old Act\.  1997, c\.¬†31, s\.¬†113¬†\(5\)\.

Continued

\(2\)¬†¬†An education development charge by\-law of an old board continues as an education development charge by\-law of each successor board of the old board whose area of jurisdiction includes part of the area to which the by\-law applies\.  1997, c\.¬†31, s\.¬†113¬†\(5\)\.

Application of old Act, new Act

\(3\)¬†¬†The old Act continues to apply to a by\-law continued under subsection \(2\) except that sections 257\.80 to 257\.91 and 257\.94 to 257\.100 apply instead of the corresponding provisions of the old Act\.  1997, c\.¬†31, s\.¬†113¬†\(5\)\.

Duration of continued by\-law

\(4\)¬†¬†Unless it expires or is repealed earlier, a by\-law continued under subsection \(2\) expires at the end of August 31, 1999\.  1997, c\.¬†31, s\.¬†113¬†\(5\); 1998, c\.¬†33, s\.¬†46\.

Note:  The amendments made by the Statutes of Ontario, 1998, chapter 33 apply, except where the context otherwise requires, with respect to the entire 1998 taxation year not just that portion of it that follows December 18, 1998\.  See:  1998, c\.¬†33, s\.¬†47¬†\(1\)\.

Modifications of by\-law

\(5\)¬†¬†The following apply to a by\-law of a board continued under subsection \(2\):

	1\.	The area to which the by\-law applies is restricted to the area that the by\-law applied to immediately before this section comes into force that is within the area of jurisdiction of the board\.

	2\.	If the education development charge by\-law of the old board was continued as a by\-law of more than one successor board and any of the areas to which the continued by\-laws apply overlap, the education development charges payable in respect of land in the areas of overlap shall be determined, in accordance with the regulations, so that the education development charges payable under the continued by\-laws do not exceed the amount that would have been payable had the by\-law continued as the by\-law of a single board\.  1997, c\.¬†31, s\.¬†113¬†\(5\)\.

Amendment, repeal of by\-law

\(6\)¬†¬†A board may, under the old Act, amend or repeal an education development charge by\-law continued under subsection \(2\) but the board may not pass a new education development charge by\-law under that Act\.  1997, c\.¬†31, s\.¬†113¬†\(5\)\.

Restriction, while continued by\-law in force

\(7\)¬†¬†A board shall not pass an education development charge by\-law under this Division that applies to an area to which a by\-law of the board continued under subsection \(2\) applies\.  1997, c\.¬†31, s\.¬†113¬†\(5\)\.

Certain by\-laws passed under old Act

\(8\)¬†¬†Despite subsection \(2\), an education development charge by\-law of an old board passed on or after September 22, 1997 but before the day this section comes into force expires upon the coming into force of this section\.  1997, c\.¬†31, s\.¬†113¬†\(5\)\.

Same, refund of charges paid

\(9\)¬†¬†An education development charge paid under a by\-law of an old board described under subsection \(8\) shall be refunded to the person who paid it and the obligation to refund the charge shall be deemed to be a liability of the old board that shall be transferred to one or more boards\.  1997, c\.¬†31, s\.¬†113¬†\(5\)\.
