Preamble

Ontario is home to a large and vibrant Lebanese community\. Ever since the late 19th century, when the first Lebanese immigrants arrived in Canada, the Lebanese Canadian community throughout Ontario has made and continues to make significant contributions across all fields including in science, education, medicine, law, politics, business, sports and culture\. Lebanese Canadians play an integral role in communities across Ontario and truly enrich the multicultural diversity of the province\.  

November is a significant month for the Lebanese community\. Each year in November, Lebanese people around the world celebrate Lebanese Independence Day in commemoration of their nation gaining independence on November 22, 1943\.

By proclaiming the month of November as Lebanese Heritage Month, the Province of Ontario recognizes the meaningful contributions Lebanese Canadians have made to Ontario’s social, economic, political and cultural fabric\. Lebanese Heritage Month is an opportunity to remember, celebrate and educate future generations about Lebanese Canadians and their continuing role in helping to foster growth, prosperity and innovation throughout Ontario\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Lebanese Heritage Month

__1 __The month of November in each year is proclaimed as Lebanese Heritage Month\.

2 Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

3__ __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
