Purposes

<a id="BK1"></a>__1 __The purposes of this Act are,

	\(i\)	allowing those who have been found to be incapable to apply to a tribunal for a review of the finding,

	\(ii\)	allowing incapable persons to request that a representative of their choice be appointed by the tribunal for the purpose of making decisions on their behalf concerning treatment, admission to a care facility or personal assistance services, and

Principles for giving or refusing consent

<a id="BK56"></a>__42 __\(1\)  A person who gives or refuses consent on an incapable person’s behalf to his or her admission to a care facility shall do so in accordance with the following principles:

	1\.	If the person knows of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person expressed while capable and after attaining 16 years of age, the person shall give or refuse consent in accordance with the wish\.

	2\.	If the person does not know of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person expressed while capable and after attaining 16 years of age, or if it is impossible to comply with the wish, the person shall act in the incapable person’s best interests\.  1996, c\. 2, Sched\. A, s\. 42 \(1\)\.

Best interests

\(2\)  In deciding what the incapable person’s best interests are, the person who gives or refuses consent on his or her behalf shall take into consideration,

	\(a\)	the values and beliefs that the person knows the incapable person held when capable and believes he or she would still act on if capable;

	\(b\)	any wishes expressed by the incapable person with respect to admission to a care facility that are not required to be followed under paragraph 1 of subsection \(1\); and

	\(c\)	the following factors:

	1\.	Whether admission to the care facility is likely to,

	i\.	improve the quality of the incapable person’s life,

	ii\.	prevent the quality of the incapable person’s life from deteriorating, or

	iii\.	reduce the extent to which, or the rate at which, the quality of the incapable person’s life is likely to deteriorate\.

	2\.	Whether the quality of the incapable person’s life is likely to improve, remain the same or deteriorate without admission to the care facility\.

	3\.	Whether the benefit the incapable person is expected to obtain from admission to the care facility outweighs the risk of negative consequences to him or her\.

	4\.	Whether a course of action that is less restrictive than admission to the care facility is available and is appropriate in the circumstances\.  1996, c\. 2, Sched\. A, s\. 42 \(2\)\.

<a id="BK83"></a>__54\.7 __\(1\)  A person who gives or refuses consent on an incapable person’s behalf to his or her confining in a care facility shall do so in accordance with the following principles:

	1\.	If the person knows of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person expressed while capable and after attaining 16 years of age, the person shall give or refuse consent in accordance with the wish\.

	2\.	If the person does not know of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the incapable person expressed while capable and after attaining 16 years of age, or if it is impossible to comply with the wish, the person shall act in the incapable person’s best interests\. 2017, c\. 25, Sched\. 5, s\. 60\.

Best interests

\(2\)  In deciding what the incapable person’s best interests are, the person who gives or refuses consent on the incapable person’s behalf shall take into consideration,

	\(a\)	the values and beliefs that the person knows the incapable person held when capable and believes that the incapable person would still act on if capable;

	\(b\)	any wishes expressed by the incapable person with respect to confining in a care facility that are not required to be followed under paragraph 1 of subsection \(1\); and

	\(c\)	the following factors:

	\(i\)	whether confining in the care facility is likely to,

	\(A\)	improve the quality of the incapable person’s life,

	\(B\)	prevent the quality of the incapable person’s life from deteriorating, or

	\(C\)	reduce the extent to which, or the rate at which, the quality of the incapable person’s life is likely to deteriorate,

	\(ii\)	whether the quality of the incapable person’s life is likely to improve, remain the same or deteriorate without confining in the care facility,

	\(iii\)	whether the benefit the incapable person is expected to obtain from confining in the care facility outweighs the risk of negative consequences to the incapable person,

	\(iv\)	whether a course of action that is less restrictive than confining in the care facility is available and is appropriate in the circumstances\. 2017, c\. 25, Sched\. 5, s\. 60\.

Confining

\(3\)  Subject to paragraph 1 of subsection \(1\), the person shall not give consent on the incapable person’s behalf to the incapable person’s confining in a care facility, unless the confining is essential to prevent serious bodily harm to the incapable person or to others, or allows the incapable person greater freedom or enjoyment\. 2017, c\. 25, Sched\. 5, s\. 60\.

Withdrawal of consent

\(4\)  Authority to consent on an incapable person’s behalf to the person’s confining in a care facility includes authority to withdraw the consent at any time\. 2017, c\. 25, Sched\. 5, s\. 60\.

Determining who may make decision

<a id="BK105"></a>__58 __For the purpose of determining who is authorized to make a decision concerning a personal assistance service on behalf of a recipient who is incapable with respect to the service,

	\(a\)	section 20, except subsections 20 \(5\) and \(6\), applies with necessary modifications;

	\(b\)	if no person described in subsection 20 \(1\) meets the requirements of subsection 20 \(2\), the Public Guardian and Trustee may make the decision concerning the personal assistance service; and

	\(c\)	if two or more persons who are described in the same paragraph of subsection 20 \(1\) and who meet the requirements of subsection 20 \(2\) disagree about the decision to be made concerning the personal assistance service, and if their claims rank ahead of all others, the Public Guardian and Trustee may make the decision in their stead\.  1996, c\. 2, Sched\.

Principles for making decision

<a id="BK106"></a>__59 __\(1\)  A person who makes a decision on an incapable recipient’s behalf concerning a personal assistance service shall do so in accordance with the following principles:

	1\.	If the person knows of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the recipient expressed while capable and after attaining 16 years of age, the person shall make the decision in accordance with the wish\.

If the person does not know of a wish applicable to the circumstances that the recipient expressed while capable and after attaining 16 years of age, or if it is impossible to comply with the wish, the person shall act in the recipient’s best interests\.  1996, c\. 2, Sched\. A, s\. 59 \(1\)\.

Best interests

\(2\)  In deciding what the recipient’s best interests are, the person shall take into consideration,

	\(a\)	the values and beliefs that the person knows the recipient held when capable and believes he or she would still act on if capable;

	\(b\)	any wishes expressed by the recipient with respect to the personal assistance service that are not required to be followed under paragraph 1 of subsection \(1\); and

	\(c\)	the following factors:

	1\.	Whether the personal assistance service is likely to,

	i\.	improve the quality of the recipient’s life,

	ii\.	prevent the quality of the recipient’s life from deteriorating, or

	iii\.	reduce the extent to which, or the rate at which, the quality of the recipient’s life is likely to deteriorate\.

	2\.	Whether the quality of the recipient’s life is likely to improve, remain the same or deteriorate without the personal assistance service\.

	3\.	Whether the benefit the recipient is expected to obtain from the personal assistance service outweighs the risk of harm to him or her\.

	4\.	Whether a less restrictive or less intrusive personal assistance service would be as beneficial as the personal assistance service that is the subject of the decision\.

	5\.	Whether the personal assistance service fosters the recipient’s independence\.  1996, c\. 2, Sched\. A, s\. 59 \(2\)\.

Confinement, monitoring devices, restraint

\(3\)  Subject to paragraph 1 of subsection \(1\), the person shall not give consent on the recipient’s behalf to the use of confinement, monitoring devices or means of restraint, unless the practice is essential to prevent serious bodily harm to the recipient or to others, or allows the recipient greater freedom or enjoyment\.  1996, c\. 2, Sched\. A, s\. 59 \(3\)\.

Participation

\(4\)  The person shall encourage the recipient to participate, to the best of his or her abilities, in the person’s decision concerning the personal assistance service\.  1996, c\. 2, Sched\. A, s\. 59 \(4\)\.
