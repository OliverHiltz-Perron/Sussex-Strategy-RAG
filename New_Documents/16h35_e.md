Preamble

Ontario is home to a large and vibrant Hindu community\. Since the first Hindu immigrants arrived in Canada at the beginning of the 20th century, Hindu Canadians from across Ontario have made significant contributions across all fields: science, education, medicine, law, politics, business, culture and sports\. Hindu Canadians have helped build Ontario into the multicultural success story that it is and have helped to build this province into the best place to live, work and raise families\. They continue to help foster growth, prosperity and innovation throughout Ontario\.

“Deepawali” or “Diwali” is the biggest of all celebratory festivals that members of the Hindu community celebrate\. It falls in either November or October each year, depending on the cycle of the moon\. It’s observed on the 15th day of Kartik, the holiest month in the Hindu lunar calendar\. Diwali commemorates the victory of good over evil\. In addition, during this time of the year, Hindus also celebrate other significant festivals such as Navratri and Durga Puja\.

By proclaiming the month of November as Hindu Heritage Month, the Province of Ontario recognizes the important contributions that Hindu Canadians have made to Ontario’s social, economic, political and cultural fabric\. Hindu Heritage Month is an opportunity to remember, celebrate and educate future generations about Hindu Canadians and the important role that they have played and continue to play in communities across Ontario\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Hindu Heritage Month
