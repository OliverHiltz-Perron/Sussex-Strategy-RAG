Preamble

Beginning in the 1700s, the Scottish Highland Clearances displaced many of its citizens, forcing them out of their homes with no means to support their families\. Many looked to Canada to start a new life, settling in various locations across Upper Canada, joining their fellow countrymen who had fought for the Crown during the American War of Independence\. 

Once they established their homes and livelihood, they immediately set about building schools to educate their children and helped to establish the institutions necessary to build a strong and secure country\. Pride in their culture gave Scots a strong sense of identity and self\-worth, which contributed to their success and left Upper Canada with firmly rooted Scottish traditions such as Highland games and competitions\.

St\. Andrew’s Day is celebrated on November 30th and is Scotland’s official national day\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Scottish Heritage Day

__1 __November 30 in each year is proclaimed as Scottish Heritage Day\.

2 Omitted \(provides for coming into force of provisions of this Act\)\.

3__ __Omitted \(enacts short title of this Act\)\.
