Preamble

<a id="BK0"></a>The Government of Ontario has announced a capital investment plan for Ontario under which the Government, municipalities and other public bodies, and the private sector will work together to make significant investments in the province’s infrastructure\. Under the capital investment plan three new Crown agencies will be established and a fourth will be revitalized\. These agencies will have responsibilities in the areas of provincial investment and financing programs, transportation projects, sewer and water projects and the management of the provincial land and building inventory\. Legislation is required to establish the new Crown agencies and to continue the Ontario Land Corporation as the Ontario Realty Corporation\. Complementary amendments are required to several Acts to implement the plan and to provide for certain other matters related to the financial administration of the Province of Ontario\.

After the enactment of the Capital Investment Plan Act, 1993, legislation was enacted to amalgamate the Ontario Realty Corporation with the Ontario Infrastructure Projects Corporation and the Stadium Corporation of Ontario Limited to establish the Ontario Infrastructure and Lands Corporation\. That legislation included complementary amendments to the Capital Investment Plan Act, 1993\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:
