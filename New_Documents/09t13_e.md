Recovery for individuals or on aggregate basis

\(4\)  In an action under subsection \(1\), the Crown in right of Ontario may recover the cost of health care benefits,

	\(b\)	exposure to the type of tobacco product can cause or contribute to disease; and

Effect of presumptions

\(3\)  If the presumptions under clauses \(2\) \(a\) and \(b\) apply,

Reduction or readjustment

\(4\)  The amount of a defendant’s liability assessed under clause \(3\) \(b\) may be reduced, or the proportions of liability assessed under clause \(3\) \(b\) readjusted among the defendants, to the extent that a defendant proves on a balance of probabilities that the breach referred to in clause \(1\) \(a\) did not cause or contribute to,

	\(a\)	the exposure referred to in clause \(2\) \(a\); or

	\(b\)	the disease or risk of disease referred to in clause \(2\) \(b\)\.  2009, c\. 13, s\. 3 \(4\)\.

Joint and several liability in an action under s\. 2 \(1\)

Joint breach

\(2\)  For purposes of an action under subsection 2 \(1\), two or more manufacturers, whether or not they are defendants in the action, are deemed to have jointly breached a duty or obligation described in the definition of “tobacco related wrong” in subsection 1 \(1\) if,

	\(a\)	one or more of those manufacturers are held to have breached the duty or obligation; and

	\(b\)	at common law, in equity or under an enactment, those manufacturers would be held,

	\(iii\)	to be jointly or vicariously liable for the breach if damages would have been awarded to a person who suffered as a consequence of the breach\.  2009, c\. 13, s\. 4 \(2\)\.

Population\-based evidence to establish causation and quantify damages or cost

<a id="BK4"></a>__5 __Statistical information and information derived from epidemiological, sociological and other relevant studies, including information derived from sampling, is admissible as evidence for the purposes of establishing causation and quantifying damages or the cost of health care benefits respecting a tobacco related wrong in an action brought,

Certain actions revived

\(2\)  Any action described in subsection \(1\) for damages alleged to have been caused or contributed to by a tobacco related wrong is revived, if the action was dismissed before the coming into force of this section merely because it was held by a court to be barred or extinguished by the Limitations Act, 2002 or any other Act\.  2009, c\. 13, s\. 6 \(2\)\.

Apportioning liability

Scope

<a id="BK6"></a>__7 __\(1\)  This section applies to an action for damages, or the cost of health care benefits, alleged to have been caused or contributed to by a tobacco related wrong other than an action for the recovery of the cost of health care benefits on an aggregate basis\.  2009, c\. 13, s\. 7 \(1\)\.

Two or more defendants

\(2\)  If a plaintiff is unable to establish which defendant caused or contributed to the exposure described in clause \(b\) and, as a result of a breach of a common law, equitable or statutory duty or obligation,

Considerations

\(3\)  The court may consider the following in apportioning liability under subsection \(2\),

	\(d\)	the amount spent by a defendant on promoting the type of tobacco product that caused or contributed to the risk of disease;

	\(g\)	the extent to which a defendant assumed a leadership role in manufacturing the type of tobacco product;

	\(h\)	the efforts a defendant made to warn the public about the risk of disease resulting from exposure to the type of tobacco product;

	\(i\)	the extent to which a defendant continued manufacture or promotion of the type of tobacco product after it knew or ought to have known of the risk of disease resulting from exposure to the type of tobacco product;

\(2\)  A defendant who is found liable for a tobacco related wrong may commence, against one or more of the defendants found liable for that wrong in the same action, an action or other proceeding for contribution toward payment of the damages or the cost of health care benefits caused or contributed to by that wrong\.  2009, c\. 13, s\. 8 \(2\)\.

Action or proceeding may be commenced even if damages or costs not paid

\(3\)  Subsection \(2\) applies whether or not the defendant commencing an action or other proceeding under that subsection has paid all or any of the damages or the cost of health care benefits caused or contributed to by the tobacco related wrong\.  2009, c\. 13, s\. 8 \(3\)\.

Apportioning liability and contributions: factors

\(4\)  In an action or other proceeding described in subsection \(2\), the court may apportion liability and order contribution among each of the defendants in accordance with the considerations listed in clauses 7 \(3\) \(a\) to \(k\)\.  2009, c\. 13, s\. 8 \(4\)\.
