Preamble

Deaf\-blindness is a unique disability that incorporates the sensory loss of both sight and hearing\. Persons with this disability experience extreme isolation and the inability to access the services and information which most of us take for granted\.

June is the birth month of Helen Keller, a deaf\-blind person known around the world for her perseverance and achievements, and an inspiration to the deaf\-blind community\. It is appropriate during the month of June to celebrate the achievements of deaf\-blind persons, and to recognize that increased public awareness of this disability is crucial to increase opportunities for those who live with it\.

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:

Deaf\-Blind Awareness Month
