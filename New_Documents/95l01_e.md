Same

\(3\) Where an employer on behalf of whose employees a trade union or council of trade unions, as the case may be, has been certified as bargaining agent or has given or is entitled to give notice under section 16 or 59, sells his, her or its business, the trade union, or council of trade unions continues, until the Board otherwise declares, to be the bargaining agent for the employees of the person to whom the business was sold in the like bargaining unit in that business, and the trade union or council of trade unions is entitled to give to the person to whom the business was sold a written notice of its desire to bargain with a view to making a collective agreement or the renewal, with or without modifications, of the agreement then in operation and such notice has the same effect as a notice under section 16 or 59, as the case requires\.

Notice to bargain

\(7\) Where a trade union or council of trade unions is declared to be the bargaining agent under subsection \(6\) and it is not already bound by a collective agreement with the successor employer with respect to the employees for whom it is declared to be the bargaining agent, it is entitled to give to the employer a written notice of its desire to bargain with a view to making a collective agreement, and the notice has the same effect as a notice under section 16\.

\(9\) Where an application is made under this section, an employer is not required, despite the fact that a notice has been given by a trade union or council of trade unions, to bargain with that trade union or council of trade unions concerning the employees to whom the application relates until the Board has disposed of the application and has declared which trade union or council of trade unions, if any, has the right to bargain with the employer on behalf of the employees concerned in the application\.

Effect of notice of declaration

\(10\) For the purposes of sections 7, 63, 65, 67 and 132, a notice given by a trade union or council of trade unions under subsection \(3\) or a declaration made by the Board under subsection \(6\) has the same effect as a certification under section 10\.

	ii\.	the proposed project agreement would result in a reduction in the total wages and benefits, expressed as a rate, of an employee represented by the bargaining agent challenging the project agreement that is larger, proportionally, than the largest reduction that would apply to an employee represented by a bargaining agent that gave notice of approval of the project agreement\.

	3\.	In the circumstances described in paragraph 2, the Board shall make an order doing the following, unless the Board considers it inappropriate to do so,

	i\.	amending the proposed project agreement so that no reduction in the total wages and benefits, expressed as a rate, of an employee represented by the bargaining agent challenging the project agreement is greater, proportionally, than the largest reduction that would apply to an employee represented by a bargaining agent that gave notice of approval of the project agreement, and

	ii\.	declaring that the proposed project agreement, as amended, is in force\.

	4\.	In the circumstances described in paragraph 2, if the Board considers it inappropriate to make an order under paragraph 3, the Board may make an order declaring that the proposed project agreement shall not come into force\. 

	5\.	The Board may make an order declaring that the proposed project agreement shall not come into force if the requirements of subsections \(1\) to \(8\) have not been satisfied and the failure to satisfy the requirements affected the bargaining agent challenging the project agreement\.

	6\.	In the circumstances prescribed in the regulations, the Board may make an order declaring that the proposed project agreement shall not come into force\.  1998, c\. 8, s\. 21; 2000, c\. 38, s\. 35 \(7\)\.

When agreement comes into force

\(10\) A project agreement comes into force upon the Board making an order declaring that the proposed project agreement is in force or, if the project agreement is not challenged under subsection \(9\), upon the expiry of the time period for making such a challenge\.  1998, c\. 8, s\. 21; 2000, c\. 38, s\. 35 \(7\)\.

Notice of agreement in force

\(11\) If the project agreement comes into force, the proponent shall forthwith give notice that the project agreement is in force to the agents and agencies described in subsection \(13\)\.  1998, c\. 8, s\. 21; 2000, c\. 38, s\. 35 \(7\)\.

	1\.	The project agreement applies to all construction work on the project that is within the jurisdiction of a bargaining agent on the list\.

	2\.	Each applicable provincial agreement, as modified by the project agreement, applies to the construction work on the project, even with respect to employers who would not otherwise be bound by the provincial agreement\.

	3\.	Subject to the project agreement, if a provincial agreement ceases to apply while the project agreement is in effect, the provincial agreement that applied when the project agreement was approved applies to the construction work on the project until a new provincial agreement is made\.  However, this paragraph does not apply with respect to provincial agreements that apply to work that the project agreement does not apply to\.

	4\.	No employees performing work to which the project agreement applies shall strike and no employer shall lock\-out such employees while the project agreement is in effect even if a strike is called or authorized under subsection 164 \(1\) or a lock\-out is called or authorized under subsection 164 \(2\)\.

	5\.	For greater certainty, paragraph 4 does not affect the right to strike of an employee who performs work to which the project agreement does not apply nor does paragraph 4 affect the right of the employer to lock\-out such an employee\.  1998, c\. 8, s\. 21; 2000, c\. 38, s\. 35 \(7\)\.

	\(a\)	the employment of the members of the trade union before the project is completed or abandoned shall not be considered in any application for certification by the trade union with respect to the employer; and

	\(b\)	any agreement under which the employer agrees to employ only members of the trade union for that work before the project is completed or abandoned but not afterwards shall be deemed not to be an agreement voluntarily recognizing the trade union as the exclusive bargaining agent of those employees\.  2000, c\. 38, s\. 35 \(8\)\.

Not voluntary recognition

\(16\.1\)  A person shall be deemed not to have voluntarily recognized a trade union as an exclusive bargaining agent if,

	\(b\)	the trade union is a bargaining agent to which notice of the coming into force of a project agreement was given under subsection \(11\); and

	\(c\)	the agreement includes work on a project to which the project agreement applies\.  2000, c\. 38, s\. 35 \(8\)\.

Not party to collective agreement

\(17\)  The proponent and, if the proponent is an agent, the person who owns or has an interest in the land for which the project is planned, are not, only by reason of being a party or operating under the project agreement or an agreement that includes work on the project, parties to any collective agreement\.  2000, c\. 38, s\. 35 \(8\)\.

Same, project agreement

\(17\.1\)  Subsections \(15\) to \(17\) apply with respect to agreements entered into before the day subsection 35 \(8\) of the *Labour Relations Amendment Act, 2000* is proclaimed in force\.  2000, c\. 38, s\. 35 \(8\)\.
