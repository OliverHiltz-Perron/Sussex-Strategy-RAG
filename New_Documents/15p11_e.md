S\.o\. 2015, chapter 11

No amendments\.

Preamble

The Durham District School Board, Rainbow District School Board and Peel District School Board, and the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation are parties to collective agreements that have expired\.  Pursuant to the collective bargaining regime established by the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act, 2014, the parties have engaged in local bargaining, including conciliation with the assistance of Ministry of Labour staff, but have failed to resolve their disputes\.  Continuing efforts by the Ministry of Labour to assist the parties in resolving their differences have proved unsuccessful\.  Negotiations have reached an impasse, the parties are clearly deadlocked and strikes commenced on April 20, 27 and May 4, 2015\.

Continuation of these strikes gives rise to serious adverse impacts for students and their families\.  The education of over 70,000 students has been disrupted\.  The Education Relations Commission has advised that continuation of the strikes will place in jeopardy the successful completion of courses of study by the affected students\.  Having regard to these serious concerns and the clear deadlock in negotiations, the public interest requires an exceptional and temporary solution so that the matters in dispute may be resolved through mediation\-arbitration, and the affected students can return to school and resume their courses of study\.

Therefore, her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:
